<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>No one who is interested in the growth of human ideas
or the origins of human society can afford to neglect
Maine's <i>Ancient Law</i>. Published some fifty-six years ago it
immediately took rank as a classic, and its epoch-making
influence may not unfitly be compared to that exercised
by Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i>. The revolution effected by
the latter in the study of biology was hardly more remarkable
than that effected by Maine's brilliant treatise in the
study of early institutions. Well does one of Maine's latest
and most learned commentators say of his work that "he
did nothing less than create the natural history of law."
This is only another way of saying that he demonstrated
that our legal conceptions&mdash;using that term in its largest
sense to include social and political institutions&mdash;are as
much the product of historical development as biological
organisms are the outcome of evolution. This was a new
departure, inasmuch as the school of jurists, represented by
Bentham and Austin, and of political philosophers, headed
by Hobbes, Locke, and their nineteenth-century disciples,
had approached the study of law and political society
almost entirely from an unhistoric point of view and had
substituted dogmatism for historical investigation. They
had read history, so far as they troubled to read it at all,
"backwards," and had invested early man and early
society with conceptions which, as a matter of fact, are
themselves historical products. The jurists, for example,
had in their analysis of legal sovereignty postulated the
commands of a supreme lawgiver by simply ignoring the
fact that, in point of time, custom precedes legislation and
that early law is, to use Maine's own phrase, "a habit"
and not a conscious exercise of the volition of a lawgiver
or a legislature. The political philosophers, similarly, had
sought the origin of political society in a "state of nature"&mdash;humane,
according to Locke and Rousseau, barbarous,
according to Hobbes&mdash;in which men freely subscribed to
<span class='pagenum'>viii</span>an "original contract" whereby each submitted to the
will of all. It was not difficult to show, as Maine has done,
that contract&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the recognition of a mutual agreement
as binding upon the parties who make it&mdash;is a conception
which comes very late to the human mind. But Maine's
work covers much wider ground than this. It may be
summed up by saying that he shows that early society, so
far as we have any recognisable legal traces of it, begins
with the group, not with the individual.</p>

<p>This group was, according to Maine's theory, the Family&mdash;that
is to say the Family as resting upon the patriarchal
power of the father to whom all its members, wife, sons,
daughters, and slaves, were absolutely subject. This,
the central feature of Maine's speculation, is worked out
with infinite suggestiveness and great felicity of style in
chapter V. ("Primitive Society and Ancient Law") of
the present work, and his chief illustrations are sought in
the history of Roman law. The topics of the other chapters
are selected largely with a view to supplying confirmation
of the theory in question and, as we shall see in a moment,
Maine's later works do but serve to carry the train of
reasoning a step further by the use of the Comparative
Method in invoking evidence from other sources, notably
from Irish and Hindu Law. Let us, however, confine ourselves
for the moment to "Ancient Law." Maine works out
the implications of his theory by showing that it, and it
alone, can serve to explain such features of early Roman
law as Agnation, <i>i.e.</i> the tracing of descent exclusively
through males, and Adoption, <i>i.e.</i> the preservation of the
family against the extinction of male heirs. The perpetual
tutelage of women is the consequence of this position.
Moreover, all the members of the family, except its head,
are in a condition best described as <i>status</i>: they have no
power to acquire property, or to bequeath it, or to enter
into contracts in relation to it. The traces of this state
of society are clearly visible in the pages of that classical
text-book of Roman Law, the <i>Institutes</i> of Justinian,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> compiled
in the sixth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, though equally visible is
the disintegration wrought in it by the reforming activity
<span class='pagenum'>ix</span>of the praetor's edicts. That reformation followed the
course of a gradual emancipation of the members of the
family, except those under age, from the despotic authority
of the father. This gradual substitution of the Individual for
the Family was effected in a variety of ways, but in none
more conspicuously than by the development of the idea
of contract, <i>i.e.</i> of the capacity of the individual to enter
into independent agreements with strangers to his family-group
by which he was legally bound&mdash;an historical process
which Maine sums up in his famous aphorism that the
movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a
movement from Status to Contract.</p>

<p>In the chapters on the early history of Wills, Property,
and Contract, Maine supports his theory by showing that
it is the key which unlocks many, if not all, of the problems
which those topics present. The chapter on Wills&mdash;particularly
the passage in which he explains what is meant
by Universal Succession&mdash;is a brilliant example of Maine's
analytic power. He shows that a Will&mdash;in the sense of a
secret and revocable disposition of property only taking
effect after the death of the testator&mdash;is a conception unknown
to early law, and that it makes its first appearance
as a means of transmitting the exercise of domestic sovereignty,
the transfer of the property being only a subsidiary
feature; wills only being permitted, in early times,
in cases where there was likely to be a failure of proper
heirs. The subsequent popularity of wills, and the indulgence
with which the law came to regard them, were
due to a desire to correct the rigidity of the Patria Potestas,
as reflected in the law of intestate succession, by giving free
scope to natural affection. In other words, the conception
of relationship as reckoned only through males, and as
resting on the continuance of the children within their
father's power, gave way, through the instrumentality of
the will, to the more modern and more natural conception
of relationship.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Property Maine again shows that the
theory of its origin in occupancy is too individualistic and
that not separate ownership but joint ownership is the
really archaic institution. The father was in some sense
(we must avoid importing modern terms) the trustee of
the joint property of the family. Here Maine makes an
<span class='pagenum'>x</span>excursion into the fields of the Early Village Community,
and has, too, to look elsewhere than to Rome, where the
village community had already been transformed by
coalescence into the city-state. He therefore seeks his
examples from India and points to the Indian village as
an example of the expansion of the family into a larger
group of co-proprietors, larger but still bearing traces of
its origin to the patriarchal power. And, to quote his
own words, "the most important passage in the history
of Private Property is its gradual separation from the
co-ownership of kinsmen." The chapter on Contract,
although it contains some of Maine's most suggestive
writing, and the chapter on Delict and Crime, have a less
direct bearing on his main thesis except in so far as they
go to show that the reason why there is so little in early
law of what we call civil, as distinct from criminal, law,
and in particular of the Law of Contract, is to be found
in the fact that, in the infancy of society, the Law of
Persons, and with it the law of civil rights, is merged in
the common subjection to Paternal Power.</p>

<p>Such, putting it in the simplest possible language, is the
main argument of <i>Ancient Law</i>. The exigencies of space
and of simplicity compel me to pass by, to a large extent,
most of the other topics with which Maine deals&mdash;the place
of custom, code, and fiction in the development of early
law, the affiliation of international Law to the <i>Jus Gentium</i>
and the Law of Nature, the origins of feudalism and of
primogeniture, the early history of delict and crime, and
that most remarkable and profound passage in which Maine
shows the heavy debt of the various sciences to Roman law
and the influence which it has exerted on the vocabulary
of political science, the concepts of moral philosophy, and
the doctrines of theology. I must confine myself to two
questions: how far did Maine develop or modify in his
subsequent writings the main thesis of <i>Ancient Law</i>? to
what extent has this thesis stood the test of the criticism
and research of others? As regards the first point, it is
to be remembered that <i>Ancient Law</i> is but the first, though
doubtless the most important, of a whole series of works
by its author on the subject of early law. It was followed
at intervals by three volumes: <i>Village Communities in the
East and West</i>, <i>Early Institutions</i>, and <i>Early Law and</i>
<span class='pagenum'>xi</span><i>Custom</i>. In the first of these he dealt with a subject which
has excited an enormous degree of attention and not a
little controversy among English, French, German, and
Russian scholars,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> amounting as it does to nothing less
than an investigation into the origin of private property
in land. The question has been put in various forms: did
it commence with joint (or, as some would put it, less justifiably,
communal or corporate) ownership or with individual
ownership, and again was the village community free or
servile? It is now pretty generally recognised that there
was more than one type, though common cultivation was
doubtless a feature of them all, and even in India there
were at least two types, of which the one presenting several,
as opposed to communal, ownership is not the less ancient.
But it may well be that, as Maitland so often pointed out,
much of the controversy has been literally an anachronism;
that is to say, that nineteenth-century men have been asking
the Early Ages questions which they could not answer
and reading back into early history distinctions which are
themselves historical products. Ownership is itself a late
abstraction developed out of use. We may say with some
certainty that family "ownership" preceded individual
ownership, but in what sense there was communal ownership
by a whole village it is not so easy to say.</p>

<p>Maine was on surer ground when, as in his studies of
Irish and Hindu law, he confined himself to the more
immediate circle of the family group. In his <i>Early Institutions</i>
he subjects the Brehon Laws of early Ireland to a
suggestive examination as presenting an example of Celtic
law largely unaffected by Roman influences. He there
shows, as he has shown in <i>Ancient Law</i>, that in early times
the only social brotherhood recognised was that of kinship,
and that almost every form of social organisation, tribe,
guild, and religious fraternity, was conceived of under a
similitude of it. Feudalism converted the village community,
based on a real or assumed consanguinity of its
members, into the fief in which the relations of tenant and
lord were those of contract, while those of the unfree tenant
<span class='pagenum'>xii</span>rested on status. In his <i>Early Law and Custom</i> he pursues
much the same theme by an examination of Hindu Law
as presenting a peculiarly close implication of early law
with religion. Here he devotes his attention chiefly to
Ancestor-worship, a subject which about this time had
engaged the attention, as regards its Greek and Roman
forms, of that brilliant Frenchman, Fustel de Coulanges,
whose monograph <i>La Cit&eacute; Antique</i> is now a classic. As is
well known, the right of inheriting a dead man's property
and the duty of performing his obsequies are co-relative to
this day in Hindu law, and his investigation of this subject
brings Maine back to the subject of the Patriarchal Power.
He points out that both worshipper and the object of
worship were exclusively males, and concludes that it was
the power of the father which generated the practice of
worshipping him, while this practice in turn, by the gradual
admission of women to participate in the ceremonies,
gradually acted as a solvent upon the power itself. The
necessity of finding some one to perform these rites, on
failure of direct male heirs, marked the beginning of the
recognition of a right in women to inherit. The conception
of the family becomes less intense and more extensive.
These discussions brought Maine, in chapter VII. of <i>Early
Law and Custom</i>, to reconsider the main theory of <i>Ancient
Law</i> in the light of the criticism to which it had been
exposed, and every reader of <i>Ancient Law</i> who desires to
understand Maine's exact position in regard to the scope
of his generalisations should read for himself the chapter
in the later work entitled "Theories of Primitive Society."
His theory of the patriarchal power had been criticised by
two able and industrious anthropologists, M'Lennan and
Morgan, who, by their investigation of "survivals" among
barbarous tribes in our own day, had arrived at the conclusion
that, broadly speaking, the normal process through
which society had passed was not patriarchal but "matriarchal,"
<i>i.e.</i> understanding by that term a system in which
descent is traced through females. It would take up far
too much space to enter into this controversy in detail. It
is sufficient to say that the counter-theory rested on the
assumption that society originated not in families, based
on the authority of the father and relationship through him,
but in promiscuous hordes among whom the only certain
<span class='pagenum'>xiii</span>fact, and, consequently, the only recognised basis of relationship,
was maternity. Maine's answer to this was that his
generalisations as to the prevalence of the patriarchal power
were confined to Indo-European races, and that he did not
pretend to dogmatise about other races, also that he was
dealing not with all societies but all that had any permanence.
He argues that the promiscuous horde, where and
when it is found, is to be explained as an abnormal case of
retrogression due to a fortuitous scarcity of females resulting
in polyandry, and he opposes to the theory of its predominance
the potency of sexual jealousy which might
serve as only another name for the patriarchal power. On
the whole the better opinion is certainly with Maine. His
theory, at any rate, alone accords with a view of society so
soon as it is seen to possess any degree of civilisation and
social cohesion.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Maine's work, like that of most great
thinkers, presents a singular coherence and intellectual
elegance. It is distinguished also by an extraordinary
wide range of vision. He lays under contribution with
equal felicity and suggestiveness the Old Testament, the
Homeric poems, the Latin dramatists, the laws of the
Barbarians, the sacerdotal laws of the Hindus, the oracles
of the Brehon caste, and the writings of the Roman jurists.
In other words, he was a master of the Comparative Method.
Few writers have thrown so much light on the development
of the human mind in its social relations. We know now&mdash;a
hundred disciples have followed in Maine's footsteps
and applied his teaching&mdash;how slow is the growth of the
human intellect in these matters, with what painful steps
man learns to generalise, how convulsively he clings in the
infancy of civilisation to the formal, the material, the
realistic aspects of things, how late he develops such
abstractions as "the State." In all this Maine first showed
the way. As Sir Frederick Pollock has admirably put it&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nowadays it may be said that "all have got the seed," but
this is no justification for forgetting who first cleared and sowed
the ground. We may till fields that the master left untouched,
and one man will bring a better ox to yoke to the plough, and
another a worse; but it is the master's plough still.</p></div>

<p>We may conclude with some remarks on Maine's views
<span class='pagenum'>xiv</span>of the contemporary problems of political society. Maine
was what, for want of a better term, may be called a
Conservative, and, indeed, it may be doubted whether,
with the single exception of Burke, any English writer has
done more to provide English Conservatives with reasons
for the faith that is in them. He has set forth his views
in a collection of polemical essays under the title of <i>Popular
Government</i>, which were given to the world in book form in
1885. He viewed the advent of Democracy with more
distrust than alarm&mdash;he appears to have thought it a form
of government which could not last&mdash;and he has an unerring
eye for its weaknesses.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Indeed, his remarks on the
facility with which Democracy yields itself to manipulation
by wire-pullers, newspapers, and demagogues, have found
not a little confirmation in such studies of the actual working
of democratic government as M. Ostrogorski's <i>Democracy
and the Organisation of Political Parties</i>. Maine emphasised
the tyranny of majorities, the enslavement of untutored
minds by political catchwords, their susceptibility to
"suggestion," their readiness to adopt vicarious opinion
in preference to an intellectual exercise of their own volition.
It is not surprising that the writer who had subjected the
theories of the Social Contract to such merciless criticism
sighed for a scientific analysis of political terms as the first
step to clear thinking about politics. Here he was on
strong ground, but for such an analysis we have yet to
wait.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> He seems to have placed his hopes in the adoption
of some kind of written constitution which, like the American
prototype, would safeguard us from fundamental changes
by the caprice of a single assembly. But this is not the
place to pursue such highly debateable matters. Enough
if we say that the man who wishes to serve an apprenticeship
to an intelligent understanding of the political society
<span class='pagenum'>xv</span>of the present cannot do better than begin by a careful
study of Maine's researches into the political society of
the past.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The reader who desires to study Maine in the light of
modern criticism is recommended to read Sir F. Pollock's "Notes
on Maine's <i>Ancient Law</i>" (published by John Murray at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
or, with the text, at 5<i>s.</i>). The best short study of Maine with
which I am acquainted is the article by Professor Vinogradoff in
the <i>Law Quarterly Review</i> for April 1904. The field of research
covered by Maine in his various writings is so vast that it is
impossible to refer the reader, except at great length, to anything
like an adequate list of later books on the subjects of his investigation.
In addition to the works on the Village Community
mentioned in a previous footnote, I may, however, refer the
beginner to Mr. Edward Jenks' little book on <i>The History of
Politics</i> in Dent's Primers, to Professor Ashley's translation of a
fragment of Fustel de Coulanges under the title of <i>The Origin
of Property in Land</i>, and to Sir Frederick Pollock's brilliant little
book, <i>The Expansion of the Common Law</i>. The reader is also
recommended to study Mr. H.A.L. Fisher's succinct survey of
the contributions of Maitland to legal history under the title of
<i>F.W. Maitland; an Appreciation</i> (Cambridge University Press).
One of the most brilliant and ingenious studies of the origins of
European civilisation is to be found in the work of the great
German jurist, Ihering, <i>Die Vorgeschichte der Indo-Europder</i>,
translated into English under the title of <i>The Early History of
the Indo-European Races</i> (Sonnenschein, 1897).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">2</span></a> English literature on the subject is best studied in Maitland's
<i>Domesday Book and Beyond</i>, Vinogradoff's <i>The Growth of the Manor</i>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">3</span></a> Witness the characteristic sentence: "On the whole they [<i>i.e.</i> the

of change, separate the civilised man from savage or barbarian, are
not so great as the vulgar opinion would have them.... Like the

<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>The chief object of the following pages is to indicate some of
the earliest ideas of mankind, as they are reflected in Ancient
Law, and to point out the relation of those ideas to modern
thought. Much of the inquiry attempted could not have been
prosecuted with the slightest hope of a useful result if there
had not existed a body of law, like that of the Romans,
bearing in its earliest portions the traces of the most remote
antiquity and supplying from its later rules the staple of the
civil institutions by which modern society is even now controlled.
The necessity of taking the Roman law as a typical
system has compelled the author to draw from it what may
appear a disproportionate number of his illustrations; but
it has not been his intention to write a treatise on Roman
jurisprudence, and he has as much as possible avoided all
discussions which might give that appearance to his work.
The space allotted in the third and fourth chapters to certain
philosophical theories of the Roman Jurisconsults has been
appropriated to them for two reasons. In the first place,
those theories appear to the author to have had a wider and
more permanent influence on the thought and action of the
world than is usually supposed. Secondly, they are believed
to be the ultimate source of most of the views which have
been prevalent, till quite recently, on the subjects treated of
in this volume. It was impossible for the author to proceed
far with his undertaking without stating his opinion on the
origin, meaning, and value of those speculations.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">ancient codes</span></h4>


<p>The most celebrated system of jurisprudence known to the
world begins, as it ends, with a Code. From the commencement
to the close of its history, the expositors of Roman Law
consistently employed language which implied that the body
of their system rested on the Twelve Decemviral Tables, and
therefore on a basis of written law. Except in one particular,
no institutions anterior to the Twelve Tables were
recognised at Rome. The theoretical descent of Roman
jurisprudence from a code, the theoretical ascription of
English law to immemorial unwritten tradition, were the
chief reasons why the development of their system differed
from the development of ours. Neither theory corresponded
exactly with the facts, but each produced consequences of
the utmost importance.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that the publication of the Twelve Tables
is not the earliest point at which we can take up the history
of law. The ancient Roman code belongs to a class of which
almost every civilised nation in the world can show a sample,
and which, so far as the Roman and Hellenic worlds were
concerned, were largely diffused over them at epochs not
widely distant from one another. They appeared under
exceedingly similar circumstances, and were produced, to
our knowledge, by very similar causes. Unquestionably,
many jural phenomena lie behind these codes and preceded
them in point of time. Not a few documentary records exist
which profess to give us information concerning the early
phenomena of law; but, until philology has effected a complete
analysis of the Sanskrit literature, our best sources
of knowledge are undoubtedly the Greek Homeric poems,
considered of course not as a history of actual occurrences,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">002</a></span>
but as a description, not wholly idealised, of a state of society
known to the writer. However the fancy of the poet may
have exaggerated certain features of the heroic age, the
prowess of warriors and the potency of gods, there is no
reason to believe that it has tampered with moral or metaphysical
conceptions which were not yet the subjects of
conscious observation; and in this respect the Homeric
literature is far more trustworthy than those relatively later
documents which pretend to give an account of times similarly
early, but which were compiled under philosophical or theological
influences. If by any means we can determine the
early forms of jural conceptions, they will be invaluable to us.
These rudimentary ideas are to the jurist what the primary
crusts of the earth are to the geologist. They contain,
potentially, all the forms in which law has subsequently
exhibited itself. The haste or the prejudice which has
generally refused them all but the most superficial examination,
must bear the blame of the unsatisfactory condition in
which we find the science of jurisprudence. The inquiries
of the jurist are in truth prosecuted much as inquiry in physics
and physiology was prosecuted before observation had taken
the place of assumption. Theories, plausible and comprehensive,
but absolutely unverified, such as the Law of Nature
or the Social Compact, enjoy a universal preference over sober
research into the primitive history of society and law; and
they obscure the truth not only by diverting attention from
the only quarter in which it can be found, but by that most
real and most important influence which, when once entertained
and believed in, they are enabled to exercise on the
later stages of jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The earliest notions connected with the conception, now
so fully developed, of a law or rule of life, are those contained
in the Homeric words "Themis" and "Themistes."
"Themis," it is well known, appears in the later Greek
pantheon as the Goddess of Justice, but this is a modern
and much developed idea, and it is in a very different sense
that Themis is described in the Iliad as the assessor of Zeus.
It is now clearly seen by all trustworthy observers of the
primitive condition of mankind that, in the infancy of the
race, men could only account for sustained or periodically
recurring action by supposing a personal agent. Thus, the
wind blowing was a person and of course a divine person;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">003</a></span>
the sun rising, culminating, and setting was a person and a
divine person; the earth yielding her increase was a person
and divine. As, then, in the physical world, so in the moral.
When a king decided a dispute by a sentence, the judgment
was assumed to be the result of direct inspiration. The
divine agent, suggesting judicial awards to kings or to gods,
the greatest of kings, was <i>Themis</i>. The peculiarity of the
conception is brought out by the use of the plural. <i>Themistes</i>,
Themises, the plural of <i>Themis</i>, are the awards themselves,
divinely dictated to the judge. Kings are spoken of as if
they had a store of "Themistes" ready to hand for use;
but it must be distinctly understood that they are not laws,
but judgments. "Zeus, or the human king on earth,"
says Mr. Grote, in his History of Greece, "is not a lawmaker,
but a judge." He is provided with Themistes, but,
consistently with the belief in their emanation from above,
they cannot be supposed to be connected by any thread of
principle; they are separate, isolated judgments.</p>

<p>Even in the Homeric poems, we can see that these ideas
are transient. Parities of circumstance were probably commoner
in the simple mechanism of ancient society than
they are now, and in the succession of similar cases awards
are likely to follow and resemble each other. Here we have
the germ or rudiment of a Custom, a conception posterior
to that of Themistes or judgments. However strongly we,
with our modern associations, may be inclined to lay down
<i>&agrave; priori</i> that the notion of a Custom must precede that of
a judicial sentence, and that a judgment must affirm a Custom
or punish its breach, it seems quite certain that the historical
order of the ideas is that in which I have placed them. The
Homeric word for a custom in the embryo is sometimes
"Themis" in the singular&mdash;more often "Dike," the meaning
of which visibly fluctuates between a "judgment" and a
"custom" or "usage." &#925;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#962;, a Law, so great and famous a
term in the political vocabulary of the later Greek society,
does not occur in Homer.</p>

<p>This notion of a divine agency, suggesting the Themistes,
and itself impersonated in Themis, must be kept apart from
other primitive beliefs with which a superficial inquirer might
confound it. The conception of the Deity dictating an entire
code or body of law, as in the case of the Hindoo laws of Menu,
seems to belong to a range of ideas more recent and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">004</a></span>
advanced. "Themis" and "Themistes" are much less
remotely linked with that persuasion which clung so long and
so tenaciously to the human mind, of a divine influence
underlying and supporting every relation of life, every social
institution. In early law, and amid the rudiments of political
thought, symptoms of this belief meet us on all sides. A
supernatural presidency is supposed to consecrate and keep
together all the cardinal institutions of those times, the State,
the Race, and the Family. Men, grouped together in the
different relations which those institutions imply, are bound
to celebrate periodically common rites and to offer common
sacrifices; and every now and then the same duty is even
more significantly recognised in the purifications and expiations
which they perform, and which appear intended to
deprecate punishment for involuntary or neglectful disrespect.
Everybody acquainted with ordinary classical literature will
remember the <i>sacra gentilicia</i>, which exercised so important
an influence on the early Roman law of adoption and of wills.
And to this hour the Hindoo Customary Law, in which some
of the most curious features of primitive society are stereotyped,
makes almost all the rights of persons and all the rules
of succession hinge on the due solemnisation of fixed ceremonies
at the dead man's funeral, that is, at every point where
a breach occurs in the continuity of the family.</p>

<p>Before we quit this stage of jurisprudence, a caution may
be usefully given to the English student. Bentham, in his
<i>Fragment on Government</i>, and Austin, in his <i>Province of
Jurisprudence Determined</i>, resolve every law into a <i>command</i>
of the lawgiver, <i>an obligation</i> imposed thereby on the citizen,
and a <i>sanction</i> threatened in the event of disobedience; and
it is further predicated of the <i>command</i>, which is the first
element in a law, that it must prescribe, not a single act,
but a series or number of acts of the same class or kind.
The results of this separation of ingredients tally exactly
with the facts of mature jurisprudence; and, by a little
straining of language, they may be made to correspond in
form with all law, of all kinds, at all epochs. It is not, however,
asserted that the notion of law entertained by the
generality is even now quite in conformity with this dissection;
and it is curious that, the farther we penetrate into the
primitive history of thought, the farther we find ourselves
from a conception of law which at all resembles a compound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">005</a></span>
of the elements which Bentham determined. It is certain
that, in the infancy of mankind, no sort of legislature, not
even a distinct author of law, is contemplated or conceived
of. Law has scarcely reached the footing of custom; it is
rather a habit. It is, to use a French phrase, "in the air."
The only authoritative statement of right and wrong is a
judicial sentence after the facts, not one presupposing a law
which has been violated, but one which is breathed for the
first time by a higher power into the judge's mind at the
moment of adjudication. It is of course extremely difficult
for us to realise a view so far removed from us in point both
of time and of association, but it will become more credible
when we dwell more at length on the constitution of ancient
society, in which every man, living during the greater part of
his life under the patriarchal despotism, was practically controlled
in all his actions by a regimen not of law but of caprice.
I may add that an Englishman should be better able than
a foreigner to appreciate the historical fact that the
"Themistes" preceded any conception of law, because, amid
the many inconsistent theories which prevail concerning the
character of English jurisprudence, the most popular, or at
all events the one which most affects practice, is certainly
a theory which assumes that adjudged cases and precedents
exist antecedently to rules, principles, and distinctions.
The "Themistes" have too, it should be remarked, the
characteristic which, in the view of Bentham and Austin,
distinguishes single or mere commands from laws. A true
law enjoins on all the citizens indifferently a number of acts
similar in class or kind; and this is exactly the feature of a
law which has most deeply impressed itself on the popular
mind, causing the term "law" to be applied to mere uniformities,
successions, and similitudes. A <i>command</i> prescribes
only a single act, and it is to commands, therefore,
that "Themistes" are more akin than to laws. They are
simply adjudications on insulated states of fact, and do not
necessarily follow each other in any orderly sequence.</p>

<p>The literature of the heroic age discloses to us law in the
germ under the "Themistes" and a little more developed
in the conception of "Dike." The next stage which we
reach in the history of jurisprudence is strongly marked and
surrounded by the utmost interest. Mr. Grote, in the second
part and second chapter of his History, has fully described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">006</a></span>
the mode in which society gradually clothed itself with a
different character from that delineated by Homer. Heroic
kingship depended partly on divinely given prerogative, and
partly on the possession of supereminent strength, courage,
and wisdom. Gradually, as the impression of the monarch's
sacredness became weakened, and feeble members occurred
in the series of hereditary kings, the royal power decayed,
and at last gave way to the dominion of aristocracies. If
language so precise can be used of the revolution, we might
say that the office of the king was usurped by that council
of chiefs which Homer repeatedly alludes to and depicts.
At all events from an epoch of kingly rule we come everywhere
in Europe to an era of oligarchies; and even where the
name of the monarchical functions does not absolutely disappear,
the authority of the king is reduced to a mere shadow.
He becomes a mere hereditary general, as in Laced&aelig;mon, a
mere functionary, as the King Archon at Athens, or a mere
formal hierophant, like the <i>Rex Sacrificulus</i> at Rome. In
Greece, Italy, and Asia Minor, the dominant orders seem to
have universally consisted of a number of families united by
an assumed relationship in blood, and, though they all appear
at first to have laid claim to a quasi-sacred character, their
strength does not seem to have resided in their pretended
sanctity. Unless they were prematurely overthrown by
the popular party, they all ultimately approached very
closely to what we should now understand by a political
aristocracy. The changes which society underwent in the
communities of the further Asia occurred of course at periods
long anterior in point of time to these revolutions of the
Italian and Hellenic worlds; but their relative place in
civilisation appears to have been the same, and they seem to
have been exceedingly similar in general character. There
is some evidence that the races which were subsequently
united under the Persian monarchy, and those which peopled
the peninsula of India, had all their heroic age and their era
of aristocracies; but a military and a religious oligarchy
appear to have grown up separately, nor was the authority
of the king generally superseded. Contrary, too, to the
course of events in the West, the religious element in the East
tended to get the better of the military and political. Military
and civil aristocracies disappear, annihilated or crushed into
insignificance between the kings and the sacerdotal order;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">007</a></span>
and the ultimate result at which we arrive is, a monarch
enjoying great power, but circumscribed by the privileges
of a caste of priests. With these differences, however, that
in the East aristocracies became religious, in the West civil
or political, the proposition that a historical era of aristocracies
succeeded a historical era of heroic kings may be
considered as true, if not of all mankind, at all events of all
branches of the Indo-European family of nations.</p>

<p>The important point for the jurist is that these aristocracies
were universally the depositaries and administrators of law.
They seem to have succeeded to the prerogatives of the king,
with the important difference, however, that they do not
appear to have pretended to direct inspiration for each
sentence. The connection of ideas which caused the judgments
of the patriarchal chieftain to be attributed to superhuman
dictation still shows itself here and there in the claim
of a divine origin for the entire body of rules, or for certain
parts of it, but the progress of thought no longer permits the
solution of particular disputes to be explained by supposing
an extra-human interposition. What the juristical oligarchy
now claims is to monopolise the <i>knowledge</i> of the laws, to
have the exclusive possession of the principles by which
quarrels are decided. We have in fact arrived at the epoch
of Customary Law. Customs or Observances now exist as a
substantive aggregate, and are assumed to be precisely known
to the aristocratic order or caste. Our authorities leave us
no doubt that the trust lodged with the oligarchy was sometimes
abused, but it certainly ought not to be regarded as a
mere usurpation or engine of tyranny. Before the invention
of writing, and during the infancy of the art, an aristocracy
invested with judicial privileges formed the only expedient
by which accurate preservation of the customs of the race
or tribe could be at all approximated to. Their genuineness
was, so far as possible, insured by confiding them to the
recollection of a limited portion of the community.</p>

<p>The epoch of Customary Law, and of its custody by a
privileged order, is a very remarkable one. The condition
of the jurisprudence which it implies has left traces which
may still be detected in legal and popular phraseology. The
law, thus known exclusively to a privileged minority, whether
a caste, an aristocracy, a priestly tribe, or a sacerdotal college
is true unwritten law. Except this, there is no such thing as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">008</a></span>
unwritten law in the world. English case-law is sometimes
spoken of as unwritten, and there are some English theorists
who assure us that if a code of English jurisprudence were
prepared we should be turning unwritten law into written&mdash;a
conversion, as they insist, if not of doubtful policy, at all
events of the greatest seriousness. Now, it is quite true that
there was once a period at which the English common law
might reasonably have been termed unwritten. The elder
English judges did really pretend to knowledge of rules,
principles, and distinctions which were not entirely revealed
to the bar and to the lay-public. Whether all the law which
they claimed to monopolise was really unwritten, is exceedingly
questionable; but at all events, on the assumption that
there was once a large mass of civil and criminal rules
known exclusively to the judges, it presently ceased to be
unwritten law. As soon as the Courts at Westminster Hall
began to base their judgments on cases recorded, whether
in the year books or elsewhere, the law which they administered
became written law. At the present moment a rule of
English law has first to be disentangled from the recorded
facts of adjudged printed precedents, then thrown into a
form of words varying with the taste, precision, and knowledge
of the particular judge, and then applied to the circumstances
of the case for adjudication. But at no stage of this
process has it any characteristic which distinguishes it from
written law. It is written case-law, and only different from
code-law because it is written in a different way.</p>

<p>From the period of Customary Law we come to another
sharply defined epoch in the history of jurisprudence. We
arrive at the era of Codes, those ancient codes of which the
Twelve Tables of Rome were the most famous specimen. In
Greece, in Italy, on the Hellenised sea-board of Western Asia,
these codes all made their appearance at periods much the
same everywhere, not, I mean, at periods identical in point
of time, but similar in point of the relative progress of each
community. Everywhere, in the countries I have named,
laws engraven on tablets and published to the people take
the place of usages deposited with the recollection of a privileged
oligarchy. It must not for a moment be supposed that
the refined considerations now urged in favour of what is
called codification had any part or place in the change I
have described. The ancient codes were doubtless originally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">009</a></span>
suggested by the discovery and diffusion of the art of writing.
It is true that the aristocracies seem to have abused their
monopoly of legal knowledge; and at all events their exclusive
possession of the law was a formidable impediment to
the success of those popular movements which began to be
universal in the western world. But, though democratic
sentiment may have added to their popularity, the codes
were certainly in the main a direct result of the invention
of writing. Inscribed tablets were seen to be a better
depositary of law, and a better security for its accurate
preservation, than the memory of a number of persons however
strengthened by habitual exercise.</p>

<p>The Roman code belongs to the class of codes I have been
describing. Their value did not consist in any approach to
symmetrical classifications, or to terseness and clearness of
expression, but in their publicity, and in the knowledge which
they furnished to everybody, as to what he was to do, and
what not to do. It is, indeed, true that the Twelve Tables
of Rome do exhibit some traces of systematic arrangement,
but this is probably explained by the tradition that the framers
of that body of law called in the assistance of Greeks who
enjoyed the later Greek experience in the art of law-making.
The fragments of the Attic Code of Solon show, however, that
it had but little order, and probably the laws of Draco had
even less. Quite enough too remains of these collections,
both in the East and in the West, to show that they mingled
up religious, civil, and merely moral ordinances, without
any regard to differences in their essential character; and
this is consistent with all we know of early thought from other
sources, the severance of law from morality, and of religion
from law, belonging very distinctly to the <i>later</i> stages of
mental progress.</p>

<p>But, whatever to a modern eye are the singularities of these
Codes, their importance to ancient societies was unspeakable.
The question&mdash;and it was one which affected the whole
future of each community&mdash;was not so much whether there
should be a code at all, for the majority of ancient societies
seem to have obtained them sooner or later, and, but for the
great interruption in the history of jurisprudence created by
feudalism, it is likely that all modern law would be distinctly
traceable to one or more of these fountain-heads. But the
point on which turned the history of the race was, at what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">010</a></span>
period, at what stage of their social progress, they should have
their laws put into writing. In the western world the plebeian
or popular element in each state successfully assailed the
oligarchical monopoly, and a code was nearly universally
obtained <i>early</i> in the history of the Commonwealth. But in
the East, as I have before mentioned, the ruling aristocracies
tended to become religious rather than military or political,
and gained, therefore, rather than lost in power; while in
some instances the physical conformation of Asiatic countries
had the effect of making individual communities larger and
more numerous than in the West; and it is a known social
law that the larger the space over which a particular set of
institutions is diffused, the greater is its tenacity and vitality.
From whatever cause, the codes obtained by Eastern societies
were obtained, relatively, much later than by Western, and
wore a very different character. The religious oligarchies of
Asia, either for their own guidance, or for the relief of their
memory, or for the instruction of their disciples, seem in all
cases to have ultimately embodied their legal learning in a
code; but the opportunity of increasing and consolidating
their influence was probably too tempting to be resisted.
Their complete monopoly of legal knowledge appears to have
enabled them to put off on the world collections, not so
much of the rules actually observed as of the rules which
the priestly order considered proper to be observed. The
Hindoo code, called the Laws of Menu, which is certainly
a Brahmin compilation, undoubtedly enshrines many genuine
observances of the Hindoo race, but the opinion of the best
contemporary orientalists is, that it does not, as a whole,
represent a set of rules ever actually administered in Hindostan.
It is, in great part, an ideal picture of that which, in
the view of the Brahmins, <i>ought</i> to be the law. It is consistent
with human nature and with the special motives of
their authors, that codes like that of Menu should pretend to
the highest antiquity and claim to have emanated in their
complete form from the Deity. Menu, according to Hindoo
mythology, is an emanation from the supreme God; but the
compilation which bears his name, though its exact date is
not easily discovered, is, in point of the relative progress of
Hindoo jurisprudence, a recent production.</p>

<p>Among the chief advantages which the Twelve Tables and
similar codes conferred on the societies which obtained them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">011</a></span>
was the protection which they afforded against the frauds
of the privileged oligarchy and also against the spontaneous
depravation and debasement of the national institutions.
The Roman Code was merely an enunciation in words of the
existing customs of the Roman people. Relatively to the
progress of the Romans in civilisation, it was a remarkably
early code, and it was published at a time when Roman
society had barely emerged from that intellectual condition
in which civil obligation and religious duty are inevitably
confounded. Now a barbarous society practising a body of
customs, is exposed to some especial dangers which may be
absolutely fatal to its progress in civilisation. The usages
which a particular community is found to have adopted in
its infancy and in its primitive seats are generally those which
are on the whole best suited to promote its physical and moral
well-being; and, if they are retained in their integrity until
new social wants have taught new practices, the upward
march of society is almost certain. But unhappily there is
a law of development which ever threatens to operate upon
unwritten usage. The customs are of course obeyed by
multitudes who are incapable of understanding the true
ground of their expediency, and who are therefore left
inevitably to invent superstitious reasons for their permanence.
A process then commences which may be shortly
described by saying that usage which is reasonable generates
usage which is unreasonable. Analogy, the most valuable
of instruments in the maturity of jurisprudence, is the most
dangerous of snares in its infancy. Prohibitions and ordinances,
originally confined, for good reasons, to a single
description of acts, are made to apply to all acts of the same
class, because a man menaced with the anger of the gods for
doing one thing, feels a natural terror in doing any other
thing which is remotely like it. After one kind of food has
been interdicted for sanitary reasons, the prohibition is
extended to all food resembling it, though the resemblance
occasionally depends on analogies the most fanciful. So,
again, a wise provision for insuring general cleanliness
dictates in time long routines of ceremonial ablution; and
that division into classes which at a particular crisis of social
history is necessary for the maintenance of the national
existence degenerates into the most disastrous and blighting
of all human institutions&mdash;Caste. The fate of the Hindoo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">012</a></span>
law is, in fact, the measure of the value of the Roman code.
Ethnology shows us that the Romans and the Hindoos sprang
from the same original stock, and there is indeed a striking
resemblance between what appear to have been their original
customs. Even now, Hindoo jurisprudence has a substratum
of forethought and sound judgment, but irrational imitation
has engrafted in it an immense apparatus of cruel absurdities.
From these corruptions the Romans were protected by their
code. It was compiled while the usage was still wholesome,
and a hundred years afterwards it might have been too late.
The Hindoo law has been to a great extent embodied in
writing, but, ancient as in one sense are the compendia which
still exist in Sanskrit, they contain ample evidence that they
were drawn up after the mischief had been done. We are
not of course entitled to say that if the Twelve Tables had
not been published the Romans would have been condemned
to a civilisation as feeble and perverted as that of the Hindoos,
but thus much at least is certain, that <i>with</i> their code they
were exempt from the very chance of so unhappy a destiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">013</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">legal fictions</span></h4>


<p>When primitive law has once been embodied in a Code, there
is an end to what may be called its spontaneous development.
Henceforward the changes effected in it, if effected at all,
are effected deliberately and from without. It is impossible
to suppose that the customs of any race or tribe remained
unaltered during the whole of the long&mdash;in some instances
the immense&mdash;interval between their declaration by a patriarchal
monarch and their publication in writing. It would be
unsafe too to affirm that no part of the alteration was effected
deliberately. But from the little we know of the progress
of law during this period, we are justified in assuming that set
purpose had the very smallest share in producing change.
Such innovations on the earliest usages as disclose themselves
appear to have been dictated by feelings and modes of thought
which, under our present mental conditions, we are unable
to comprehend. A new era begins, however, with the Codes.
Wherever, after this epoch, we trace the course of legal
modification we are able to attribute it to the conscious
desire of improvement, or at all events of compassing objects
other than those which were aimed at in the primitive times.</p>

<p>It may seem at first sight that no general propositions worth
trusting can be elicited from the history of legal systems
subsequent to the codes. The field is too vast. We cannot be
sure that we have included a sufficient number of phenomena
in our observations, or that we accurately understand those
which we have observed. But the undertaking will be seen
to be more feasible, if we consider that after the epoch of codes
the distinction between stationary and progressive societies
begins to make itself felt. It is only with the progressive
that we are concerned, and nothing is more remarkable
than their extreme fewness. In spite of overwhelming evidence,
it is most difficult for a citizen of western Europe
to bring thoroughly home to himself the truth that the
civilisation which surrounds him is a rare exception in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">014</a></span>
history of the world. The tone of thought common among
us, all our hopes, fears, and speculations, would be materially
affected, if we had vividly before us the relation of the progressive
races to the totality of human life. It is indisputable
that much the greatest part of mankind has never shown
a particle of desire that its civil institutions should be improved
since the moment when external completeness was
first given to them by their embodiment in some permanent
record. One set of usages has occasionally been violently
overthrown and superseded by another; here and there a
primitive code, pretending to a supernatural origin, has been
greatly extended, and distorted into the most surprising
forms, by the perversity of sacerdotal commentators; but,
except in a small section of the world, there has been nothing
like the gradual amelioration of a legal system. There has
been material civilisation, but, instead of the civilisation expanding
the law, the law has limited the civilisation. The study
of races in their primitive condition affords us some clue to the
point at which the development of certain societies has stopped.
We can see that Brahminical India has not passed beyond
a stage which occurs in the history of all the families of mankind,
the stage at which a rule of law is not yet discriminated
from a rule of religion. The members of such a society consider
that the transgression of a religious ordinance should be
punished by civil penalties, and that the violation of a civil
duty exposes the delinquent to divine correction. In China
this point has been passed, but progress seems to have been
there arrested, because the civil laws are coextensive with
all the ideas of which the race is capable. The difference
between the stationary and progressive societies is, however,
one of the great secrets which inquiry has yet to penetrate.
Among partial explanations of it I venture to place the considerations
urged at the end of the last chapter. It may
further be remarked that no one is likely to succeed in the
investigation who does not clearly realise that the stationary
condition of the human race is the rule, the progressive the
exception. And another indispensable condition of success
is an accurate knowledge of Roman law in all its principal
stages. The Roman jurisprudence has the longest known
history of any set of human institutions. The character of
all the changes which it underwent is tolerably well ascertained.
From its commencement to its close, it was progressively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">015</a></span>
modified for the better, or for what the authors of
the modification conceived to be the better, and the course
of improvement was continued through periods at which all
the rest of human thought and action materially slackened
its pace, and repeatedly threatened to settle down into
stagnation.</p>

<p>I confine myself in what follows to the progressive societies.
With respect to them it may be laid down that social necessities
and social opinion are always more or less in advance of
Law. We may come indefinitely near to the closing of the gap
between them, but it has a perpetual tendency to reopen.
Law is stable; the societies we are speaking of are progressive.
The greater or less happiness of a people depends on the
degree of promptitude with which the gulf is narrowed.</p>

<p>A general proposition of some value may be advanced with
respect to the agencies by which Law is brought into harmony
with society. These instrumentalities seem to me to be three
in number, Legal Fictions, Equity, and Legislation. Their
historical order is that in which I have placed them. Sometimes
two of them will be seen operating together, and there
are legal systems which have escaped the influence of one or
other of them. But I know of no instance in which the order
of their appearance has been changed or inverted. The early
history of one of them, Equity, is universally obscure, and
hence it may be thought by some that certain isolated statutes,
reformatory of the civil law, are older than any equitable
jurisdiction. My own belief is that remedial Equity is everywhere
older than remedial Legislation; but, should this be not
strictly true, it would only be necessary to limit the proposition
respecting their order of sequence to the periods at which
they exercise a sustained and substantial influence in transforming
the original law.</p>

<p>I employ the word "fiction" in a sense considerably wider
than that in which English lawyers are accustomed to use it,
and with a meaning much more extensive than that which
belonged to the Roman "fictiones." Fictio, in old Roman
law, is properly a term of pleading, and signifies a false
averment on the part of the plaintiff which the defendant
was not allowed to traverse; such, for example, as an averment
that the plaintiff was a Roman citizen, when in truth
he was a foreigner. The object of these "fictiones" was,
of course, to give jurisdiction, and they therefore strongly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">016</a></span>
resembled the allegations in the writs of the English Queen's
Bench, and Exchequer, by which those Courts contrived to
usurp the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas:&mdash;the allegation
that the defendant was in custody of the king's marshal, or
that the plaintiff was the king's debtor, and could not pay his
debt by reason of the defendant's default. But I now employ
the expression "Legal Fiction" to signify any assumption
which conceals, or affects to conceal, the fact that a rule of
law has undergone alteration, its letter remaining unchanged,
its operation being modified. The words, therefore, include
the instances of fictions which I have cited from the English
and Roman law, but they embrace much more, for I should
speak both of the English Case-law and of the Roman
Responsa Prudentum as resting on fictions. Both these
examples will be examined presently. The <i>fact</i> is in both
cases that the law has been wholly changed; the <i>fiction</i> is
that it remains what it always was. It is not difficult to understand
why fictions in all their forms are particularly congenial
to the infancy of society. They satisfy the desire for improvement,
which is not quite wanting, at the same time that they
do not offend the superstitious disrelish for change which is
always present. At a particular stage of social progress they
are invaluable expedients for overcoming the rigidity of law,
and, indeed, without one of them, the Fiction of Adoption
which permits the family tie to be artificially created, it
is difficult to understand how society would ever have
escaped from its swaddling clothes, and taken its first steps
towards civilisation. We must, therefore, not suffer ourselves
to be affected by the ridicule which Bentham pours
on legal fictions wherever he meets them. To revile them as
merely fraudulent is to betray ignorance of their peculiar
office in the historical development of law. But at the same
time it would be equally foolish to agree with those theorists,
who, discerning that fictions have had their uses, argue that
they ought to be stereotyped in our system. They have had
their day, but it has long since gone by. It is unworthy of
us to effect an admittedly beneficial object by so rude a
device as a legal fiction. I cannot admit any anomaly to be
innocent, which makes the law either more difficult to understand
or harder to arrange in harmonious order. Now legal
fictions are the greatest of obstacles to symmetrical classification.
The rule of law remains sticking in the system, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">017</a></span>
is a mere shell. It has been long ago undermined, and a new
rule hides itself under its cover. Hence there is at once a
difficulty in knowing whether the rule which is actually
operative should be classed in its true or in its apparent place,
and minds of different casts will differ as to the branch of the
alternative which ought to be selected. If the English law is
ever to assume an orderly distribution, it will be necessary to
prune away the legal fictions which, in spite of some recent
legislative improvements, are still abundant in it.</p>

<p>The next instrumentality by which the adaptation of law
to social wants is carried on I call Equity, meaning by that
word any body of rules existing by the side of the original civil
law, founded on distinct principles and claiming incidentally
to supersede the civil law in virtue of a superior sanctity
inherent in those principles. The Equity whether of the
Roman Pr&aelig;tors or of the English Chancellors, differs from
the Fictions which in each case preceded it, in that the interference
with law is open and avowed. On the other hand,
it differs from Legislation, the agent of legal improvement
which comes after it, in that its claim to authority is grounded,
not on the prerogative of any external person or body, not
even on that of the magistrate who enunciates it, but on the
special nature of its principles, to which it is alleged that all
law ought to conform. The very conception of a set of principles,
invested with a higher sacredness than those of the
original law and demanding application independently of
the consent of any external body, belongs to a much more
advanced stage of thought than that to which legal fictions
originally suggested themselves.</p>

<p>Legislation, the enactments of a legislature which, whether
it take the form of an autocratic prince or of a parliamentary
assembly, is the assumed organ of the entire society, is the
last of the ameliorating instrumentalities. It differs from
Legal Fictions just as Equity differs from them, and it is
also distinguished from Equity, as deriving its authority from
an external body or person. Its obligatory force is independent
of its principles. The legislature, whatever be the actual
restraints imposed on it by public opinion, is in theory empowered
to impose what obligations it pleases on the members
of the community. There is nothing to prevent its legislating
in the wantonness of caprice. Legislation may be dictated
by equity, if that last word be used to indicate some standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">018</a></span>
of right and wrong to which its enactments happen to be
adjusted; but then these enactments are indebted for their
binding force to the authority of the legislature and not to
that of the principles on which the legislature acted; and
thus they differ from rules of Equity, in the technical sense
of the word, which pretend to a paramount sacredness entitling
them at once to the recognition of the courts even
without the concurrence of prince or parliamentary assembly.
It is the more necessary to note these differences, because
a student of Bentham would be apt to confound Fictions,
Equity, and Statute law under the single head of legislation.
They all, he would say, involve <i>law-making</i>; they differ
only in respect of the machinery by which the new law is
produced. That is perfectly true, and we must never forget
it; but it furnishes no reason why we should deprive ourselves
of so convenient a term as Legislation in the special
sense. Legislation and Equity are disjoined in the popular
mind and in the minds of most lawyers; and it will never
do to neglect the distinction between them, however conventional,
when important practical consequences follow
from it.</p>

<p>It would be easy to select from almost any regularly developed
body of rules examples of <i>legal fictions</i>, which at once
betray their true character to the modern observer. In the
two instances which I proceed to consider, the nature of the
expedient employed is not so readily detected. The first
authors of these fictions did not perhaps intend to innovate,
certainly did not wish to be suspected of innovating. There are,
moreover, and always have been, persons who refuse to see
any fiction in the process, and conventional language bears
out their refusal. No examples, therefore, can be better
calculated to illustrate the wide diffusion of legal fictions,
and the efficiency with which they perform their two-fold
office of transforming a system of laws and of concealing the
transformation.</p>

<p>We in England are well accustomed to the extension,
modification, and improvement of law by a machinery which,
in theory, is incapable of altering one jot or one line of existing
jurisprudence. The process by which this virtual legislation
is effected is not so much insensible as unacknowledged.
With respect to that great portion of our legal system which
is enshrined in cases and recorded in law reports, we habitually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">019</a></span>
employ a double language and entertain, as it would appear,
a double and inconsistent set of ideas. When a group of facts
come before an English Court for adjudication, the whole
course of the discussion between the judge and the advocate
assumes that no question is, or can be, raised which will call for
the application of any principles but old ones, or any distinctions
but such as have long since been allowed. It is
taken absolutely for granted that there is somewhere a rule
of known law which will cover the facts of the dispute now
litigated, and that, if such a rule be not discovered, it is only
that the necessary patience, knowledge, or acumen is not
forthcoming to detect it. Yet the moment the judgment has
been rendered and reported, we slide unconsciously or unavowedly
into a new language and a new train of thought.
We now admit that the new decision <i>has</i> modified the law.
The rules applicable have, to use the very inaccurate expression
sometimes employed, become more elastic. In fact they
have been changed. A clear addition has been made to the
precedents, and the canon of law elicited by comparing the
precedents is not the same with that which would have been
obtained if the series of cases had been curtailed by a single
example. The fact that the old rule has been repealed, and
that a new one has replaced it, eludes us, because we are not
in the habit of throwing into precise language the legal formulas
which we derive from the precedents, so that a change
in their tenor is not easily detected unless it is violent and
glaring. I shall not now pause to consider at length the causes
which have led English lawyers to acquiesce in these curious
anomalies. Probably it will be found that originally it was the
received doctrine that somewhere, <i>in nubibus</i> or <i>in gremio
magistratuum</i>, there existed a complete, coherent, symmetrical
body of English law, of an amplitude sufficient to furnish
principles which would apply to any conceivable combination
of circumstances. The theory was at first much more
thoroughly believed in than it is now, and indeed it may have
had a better foundation. The judges of the thirteenth century
may have really had at their command a mine of law unrevealed
to the bar and to the lay-public, for there is some
reason for suspecting that in secret they borrowed freely,
though not always wisely, from current compendia of the
Roman and Canon laws. But that storehouse was closed so
soon as the points decided at Westminster Hall became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">020</a></span>
numerous enough to supply a basis for a substantive system
of jurisprudence; and now for centuries English practitioners
have so expressed themselves as to convey the paradoxical
proposition that, except by Equity and Statute law, nothing
has been added to the basis since it was first constituted.
We do not admit that our tribunals legislate; we imply that
they have never legislated; and yet we maintain that the
rules of the English common law, with some assistance from
the Court of Chancery and from Parliament, are coextensive
with the complicated interests of modern society.</p>

<p>A body of law bearing a very close and very instructive
resemblance to our case-law in those particulars which I
have noticed, was known to the Romans under the name of
the Responsa Prudentum, the "answers of the learned in the
law." The form of these Responses varied a good deal at
different periods of the Roman jurisprudence, but throughout
its whole course they consisted of explanatory glosses on
authoritative written documents, and at first they were exclusively
collections of opinions interpretative of the Twelve
Tables. As with us, all legal language adjusted itself to the
assumption that the text of the old Code remained unchanged.
There was the express rule. It overrode all glosses and comments,
and no one openly admitted that any interpretation
of it, however eminent the interpreter, was safe from revision
on appeal to the venerable texts. Yet in point of fact, Books
of Responses bearing the names of leading jurisconsults
obtained an authority at least equal to that of our reported
cases, and constantly modified, extended, limited or practically
overruled the provisions of the Decemviral law. The
authors of the new jurisprudence during the whole progress
of its formation professed the most sedulous respect for the
letter of the Code. They were merely explaining it, deciphering
it, bringing out its full meaning; but then, in the result, by
piecing texts together, by adjusting the law to states of fact
which actually presented themselves and by speculating on
its possible application to others which might occur, by
introducing principles of interpretation derived from the
exegesis of other written documents which fell under their
observation, they educed a vast variety of canons which
had never been dreamed of by the compilers of the Twelve
Tables and which were in truth rarely or never to be found
there. All these treatises of the jurisconsults claimed respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">021</a></span>
on the ground of their assumed conformity with the Code,
but their comparative authority depended on the reputation
of the particular jurisconsults who gave them to the world.
Any name of universally acknowledged greatness clothed a
Book of Responses with a binding force hardly less than that
which belonged to enactments of the legislature; and such
a book in its turn constituted a new foundation on which a
further body of jurisprudence might rest. The Responses of
the early lawyers were not however published, in the modern
sense, by their author. They were recorded and edited by
his pupils, and were not therefore in all probability arranged
according to any scheme of classification. The part of the
students in these publications must be carefully noted, because
the service they rendered to their teacher seems to have
been generally repaid by his sedulous attention to the pupils'
education. The educational treatises called Institutes or
Commentaries, which are a later fruit of the duty then recognised,
are among the most remarkable features of the Roman
system. It was apparently in these Institutional works,
and not in the books intended for trained lawyers, that
the jurisconsults gave to the public their classifications and
their proposals for modifying and improving the technical
phraseology.</p>

<p>In comparing the Roman Responsa Prudentum with their
nearest English counterpart, it must be carefully borne in
mind that the authority by which this part of the Roman
jurisprudence was expounded was not the <i>bench</i>, but the <i>bar</i>.
The decision of a Roman tribunal, though conclusive in the
particular case, had no ulterior authority except such as was
given by the professional repute of the magistrate who
happened to be in office for the time. Properly speaking,
there was no institution at Rome during the republic analogous
to the English Bench, the Chambers of Imperial Germany,
or the Parliaments of Monarchical France. There
were magistrates indeed, invested with momentous judicial
functions in their several departments, but the tenure of the
magistracies was but for a single year, so that they are much
less aptly compared to a permanent judicature than to a
cycle of offices briskly circulating among the leaders of the
bar. Much might be said on the origin of a condition of things
which looks to us like a startling anomaly, but which was in
fact much more congenial than our own system to the spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">022</a></span>
of ancient societies, tending, as they always did, to split into
distinct orders which, however exclusive themselves, tolerated
no professional hierarchy above them.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that this system did not produce certain
effects which might on the whole have been expected from it.
It did not, for example, <i>popularise</i> the Roman law&mdash;it did not,
as in some of the Greek republics, lessen the effort of intellect
required for the mastery of the science, although its
diffusion and authoritative exposition were opposed by no
artificial barriers. On the contrary, if it had not been for the
operation of a separate set of causes, there were strong probabilities
that the Roman jurisprudence would have become
as minute, technical, and difficult as any system which has
since prevailed. Again, a consequence which might still more
naturally have been looked for, does not appear at any time
to have exhibited itself. The jurisconsults, until the liberties
of Rome were overthrown, formed a class which was quite
undefined and must have fluctuated greatly in numbers;
nevertheless, there does not seem to have existed a doubt as
to the particular individuals whose opinion, in their generation,
was conclusive on the cases submitted to them. The
vivid pictures of a leading jurisconsult's daily practice
which abound in Latin literature&mdash;the clients from the country
flocking to his antechamber in the early morning, and
the students standing round with their note-books to record
the great lawyer's replies&mdash;are seldom or never identified
at any given period with more than one or two conspicuous
names. Owing too to the direct contact of the client and the
advocate, the Roman people itself seems to have been always
alive to the rise and fall of professional reputation, and there
is abundance of proof, more particularly in the well-known
oration of Cicero, <i>Pro Mur&aelig;na</i>, that the reverence of the
commons for forensic success was apt to be excessive rather
than deficient.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that the peculiarities which have been
noted in the instrumentality by which the development of
the Roman law was first effected, were the source of its
characteristic excellence, its early wealth in principles. The
growth and exuberance of principle was fostered, in part,
by the competition among the expositors of the law, an
influence wholly unknown where there exists a Bench, the
depositaries intrusted by king or commonwealth with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">023</a></span>
prerogative of justice. But the chief agency, no doubt, was
the uncontrolled multiplication of cases for legal decision.
The state of facts which caused genuine perplexity to a
country client was not a whit more entitled to form the basis
of the jurisconsult's Response, or legal decision, than a set
of hypothetical circumstances propounded by an ingenious
pupil. All combinations of fact were on precisely the same
footing, whether they were real or imaginary. It was nothing
to the jurisconsult that his opinion was overruled for the
moment by the magistrate who adjudicated on his client's
case, unless that magistrate happened to rank above him in
legal knowledge or the esteem of his profession. I do not,
indeed, mean it to be inferred that he would wholly omit to
consider his client's advantage, for the client was in earlier
times the great lawyer's constituent and at a later period his
paymaster, but the main road to the rewards of ambition lay
through the good opinion of his order, and it is obvious that
under such a system as I have been describing this was much
more likely to be secured by viewing each case as an illustration
of a great principle, or an exemplification of a broad
rule, than by merely shaping it for an insulated forensic
triumph. A still more powerful influence must have been
exercised by the want of any distinct check on the suggestion
or invention of possible questions. Where the data can be
multiplied at pleasure, the facilities for evolving a general
rule are immensely increased. As the law is administered
among ourselves, the judge cannot travel out of the sets of
facts exhibited before him or before his predecessors. Accordingly
each group of circumstances which is adjudicated upon
receives, to employ a Gallicism, a sort of consecration. It
acquires certain qualities which distinguish it from every
other case genuine or hypothetical. But at Rome, as I have
attempted to explain, there was nothing resembling a Bench
or Chamber of judges; and therefore no combination of facts
possessed any particular value more than another. When a
difficulty came for opinion before the jurisconsult, there was
nothing to prevent a person endowed with a nice perception
of analogy from at once proceeding to adduce and consider an
entire class of supposed questions with which a particular
feature connected it. Whatever were the practical advice
given to the client, the <i>responsum</i> treasured up in the notebooks
of listening pupils would doubtless contemplate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">024</a></span>
circumstances as governed by a great principle, or included
in a sweeping rule. Nothing like this has ever been possible
among ourselves, and it should be acknowledged that in many
criticisms passed on the English law the manner in which it
has been enunciated seems to have been lost sight of. The
hesitation of our courts in declaring principles may be much
more reasonably attributed to the comparative scantiness of
our precedents, voluminous as they appear to him who is
acquainted with no other system, than to the temper of our
judges. It is true that in the wealth of legal principle we are
considerably poorer than several modern European nations,
But they, it must be remembered, took the Roman jurisprudence
for the foundation of their civil institutions. They
built the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the Roman law into their walls; but in the
materials, and workmanship of the residue there is not much
which distinguishes it favourably from the structure erected
by the English judicature.</p>

<p>The period of Roman freedom was the period during which
the stamp of a distinctive character was impressed on the
Roman jurisprudence; and through all the earlier part of it,
it was by the Responses of the jurisconsults that the development
of the law was mainly carried on. But as we approach
the fall of the republic there are signs that the Responses are
assuming a form which must have been fatal to their farther
expansion. They are becoming systematised and reduced into
compendia. Q. Mucius Sc&aelig;vola, the Pontifex, is said to have
published a manual of the entire Civil Law, and there are
traces in the writings of Cicero of growing disrelish for the
old methods, as compared with the more active instruments
of legal innovation. Other agencies had in fact by this time
been brought to bear on the law. The Edict, or annual proclamation
of the Pr&aelig;tor, had risen into credit as the principal
engine of law reform, and L. Cornelius Sylla, by causing to
be enacted the great group of statutes called the <i>Leges
Corneli&aelig;</i>, had shown what rapid and speedy improvements
can be effected by direct legislation. The final blow to the
Responses was dealt by Augustus, who limited to a few leading
jurisconsults the right of giving binding opinions on cases
submitted to them, a change which, though it brings us nearer
the ideas of the modern world, must obviously have altered
fundamentally the characteristics of the legal profession and
the nature of its influence on Roman law. At a later period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">025</a></span>
another school of jurisconsults arose, the great lights of jurisprudence
for all time. But Ulpian and Paulus, Gaius and
Papinian, were not authors of Responses. Their works were
regular treatises on particular departments of the law, more
especially on the Pr&aelig;tor's Edict.</p>

<p>The <i>Equity</i> of the Romans and the Pr&aelig;torian Edict by
which it was worked into their system, will be considered in
the next chapter. Of the Statute Law it is only necessary to
say that it was scanty during the republic, but became very
voluminous under the empire. In the youth and infancy of a
nation it is a rare thing for the legislature to be called into
action for the general reform of private law. The cry of the
people is not for change in the laws, which are usually valued
above their real worth, but solely for their pure, complete, and
easy administration; and recourse to the legislative body is
generally directed to the removal of some great abuse, or
the decision of some incurable quarrel between classes and
dynasties. There seems in the minds of the Romans to have
been some association between the enactment of a large body
of statutes and the settlement of society after a great civil
commotion. Sylla signalised his reconstitution of the republic
by the Leges Corneli&aelig;; Julius C&aelig;sar contemplated vast
additions to the Statute Law; Augustus caused to be passed
the all-important group of Leges Juli&aelig;; and among later
emperors the most active promulgators of constitutions are
princes who, like Constantine, have the concerns of the world
to readjust. The true period of Roman Statute Law does not
begin till the establishment of the empire. The enactments of
the emperors, clothed at first in the pretence of popular
sanction, but afterwards emanating undisguisedly from the
imperial prerogative, extend in increasing massiveness from
the consolidation of Augustus's power to the publication of
the Code of Justinian. It will be seen that even in the reign
of the second emperor a considerable approximation is made
to that condition of the law and that mode of administering
it with which we are all familiar. A statute law and a limited
board of expositors have risen into being; a permanent court
of appeal and a collection of approved commentaries will
very shortly be added; and thus we are brought close on the
ideas of our own day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">026</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">law of nature and equity</span></h4>


<p>The theory of a set of legal principles, entitled by their intrinsic
superiority to supersede the older law, very early
obtained currency both in the Roman state and in England.
Such a body of principles, existing in any system, has in the
foregoing chapters been denominated Equity, a term which, as
will presently be seen, was one (though only one) of the
designations by which this agent of legal change was known
to the Roman jurisconsults. The jurisprudence of the Court
of Chancery, which bears the name of Equity in England,
could only be adequately discussed in a separate treatise.
It is extremely complex in its texture and derives its materials
from several heterogeneous sources. The early ecclesiastical
chancellors contributed to it, from the Canon Law, many of
the principles which lie deepest in its structure. The Roman
law, more fertile than the Canon Law in rules applicable to
secular disputes, was not seldom resorted to by a later generation
of Chancery judges, amid whose recorded dicta we often
find entire texts from the <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i> imbedded, with
their terms unaltered, though their origin is never acknowledged.
Still more recently, and particularly at the middle
and during the latter half of the eighteenth century, the mixed
systems of jurisprudence and morals constructed by the
publicists of the Low Countries appear to have been much
studied by English lawyers, and from the chancellorship of
Lord Talbot to the commencement of Lord Eldon's chancellorship
these works had considerable effect on the rulings of
the Court of Chancery. The system, which obtained its ingredients
from these various quarters, was greatly controlled in
its growth by the necessity imposed on it of conforming itself
to the analogies of the common law, but it has always answered
the description of a body of comparatively novel legal
principles claiming to override the older jurisprudence of the
country on the strength of an intrinsic ethical superiority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">027</a></span></p>

<p>The Equity of Rome was a much simpler structure, and its
development from its first appearance can be much more
easily traced. Both its character and its history deserve
attentive examination. It is the root of several conceptions
which have exercised profound influence on human thought,
and through human thought have seriously affected the
destinies of mankind.</p>

<p>The Romans described their legal system as consisting of
two ingredients. "All nations," says the Institutional Treatise
published under the authority of the Emperor Justinian,
"who are ruled by laws and customs, are governed partly
by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which
are common to all mankind. The law which a people enacts is
called the Civil Law of that people, but that which natural
reason appoints for all mankind is called the Law of Nations,
because all nations use it." The part of the law "which natural
reason appoints for all mankind" was the element which the
Edict of the Pr&aelig;tor was supposed to have worked into Roman
jurisprudence. Elsewhere it is styled more simply Jus Naturale,
or the Law of Nature; and its ordinances are said to be
dictated by Natural Equity (<i>naturalis &aelig;quitas</i>) as well as by
natural reason. I shall attempt to discover the origin of these
famous phrases, Law of Nations, Law of Nature, Equity, and
to determine how the conceptions which they indicate are
related to one another.</p>

<p>The most superficial student of Roman history must be
struck by the extraordinary degree in which the fortunes of
the republic were affected by the presence of foreigners, under
different names, on her soil. The causes of this immigration
are discernible enough at a later period, for we can readily
understand why men of all races should flock to the mistress of
the world; but the same phenomenon of a large population
of foreigners and denizens meets us in the very earliest records
of the Roman State. No doubt, the instability of society in
ancient Italy, composed as it was in great measure of robber
tribes, gave men considerable inducement to locate themselves
in the territory of any community strong enough to
protect itself and them from external attack, even though
protection should be purchased at the cost of heavy taxation,
political disfranchisement, and much social humiliation. It
is probable, however, that this explanation is imperfect, and
that it could only be completed by taking into account those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">028</a></span>
active commercial relations which, though they are little
reflected in the military traditions of the republic, Rome
appears certainly to have had with Carthage and with the
interior of Italy in pre-historic times. Whatever were the
circumstances to which it was attributable, the foreign element
in the commonwealth determined the whole course of
its history, which, at all its stages, is little more than a narrative
of conflicts between a stubborn nationality and an alien
population. Nothing like this has been seen in modern times;
on the one hand, because modern European communities have
seldom or never received any accession of foreign immigrants
which was large enough to make itself felt by the bulk of the
native citizens, and on the other, because modern states,
being held together by allegiance to a king or political superior,
absorb considerable bodies of immigrant settlers with a quickness
unknown to the ancient world, where the original
citizens of a commonwealth always believed themselves to
be united by kinship in blood, and resented a claim to equality
of privilege as a usurpation of their birthright. In the early
Roman republic the principle of the absolute exclusion of
foreigners pervaded the Civil Law no less than the Constitution.
The alien or denizen could have no share in any institution
supposed to be coeval with the State. He could not
have the benefit of Quiritarian law. He could not be a party
to the <i>nexum</i> which was at once the conveyance and the contract
of the primitive Romans. He could not sue by the
Sacramental Action, a mode of litigation of which the origin
mounts up to the very infancy of civilisation. Still, neither
the interest nor the security of Rome permitted him to be
quite outlawed. All ancient communities ran the risk of being
overthrown by a very slight disturbance of equilibrium, and
the mere instinct of self-preservation would force the Romans
to devise some method of adjusting the rights and duties of
foreigners, who might otherwise&mdash;and this was a danger of
real importance in the ancient world&mdash;have decided their
controversies by armed strife. Moreover, at no period of
Roman history was foreign trade entirely neglected. It was
therefore probably half as a measure of police and half in
furtherance of commerce that jurisdiction was first assumed
in disputes to which the parties were either foreigners or a
native and a foreigner. The assumption of such a jurisdiction
brought with it the immediate necessity of discovering some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">029</a></span>
principles on which the questions to be adjudicated upon
could be settled, and the principles applied to this object by
the Roman lawyers were eminently characteristic of the time.
They refused, as I have said before, to decide the new cases
by pure Roman Civil Law. They refused, no doubt because it
seemed to involve some kind of degradation, to apply the law
of the particular State from which the foreign litigant came.
The expedient to which they resorted was that of selecting
the rules of law common to Rome and to the different Italian
communities in which the immigrants were born. In other
words, they set themselves to form a system answering to the
primitive and literal meaning of Jus Gentium, that is, Law
common to all Nations. Jus Gentium was, in fact, the sum of
the common ingredients in the customs of the old Italian
tribes, for they were <i>all the nations</i> whom the Romans had
the means of observing, and who sent successive swarms of
immigrants to Roman soil. Whenever a particular usage was
seen to be practised by a large number of separate races in
common it was set down as part of the Law common to all
Nations, or Jus Gentium. Thus, although the conveyance of
property was certainly accompanied by very different forms
in the different commonwealths surrounding Rome, the
actual transfer, tradition, or delivery of the article intended
to be conveyed was a part of the ceremonial in all of them.
It was, for instance, a part, though a subordinate part, in the
Mancipation or conveyance peculiar to Rome. Tradition,
therefore, being in all probability the only common ingredient
in the modes of conveyance which the jurisconsults had the
means of observing, was set down as an institution Juris
Gentium, or rule of the Law common to all Nations. A vast
number of other observances were scrutinised with the same
result. Some common characteristic was discovered in all of
them, which had a common object, and this characteristic
was classed in the Jus Gentium. The Jus Gentium was accordingly
a collection of rules and principles, determined by
observation to be common to the institutions which prevailed
among the various Italian tribes.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the origin of the Jus Gentium are
probably a sufficient safeguard against the mistake of supposing
that the Roman lawyers had any special respect for it.
It was the fruit in part of their disdain for all foreign law, and
in part of their disinclination to give the foreigner the advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">030</a></span>tage
of their own indigenous Jus Civile. It is true that we,
at the present day, should probably take a very different view
of the Jus Gentium, if we were performing the operation which
was effected by the Roman jurisconsults. We should attach
some vague superiority or precedence to the element which
we had thus discerned underlying and pervading so great a
variety of usage. We should have a sort of respect for rules
and principles so universal. Perhaps we should speak of the
common ingredient as being of the essence of the transaction
into which it entered, and should stigmatise the remaining
apparatus of ceremony, which varied in different communities,
as adventitious and accidental. Or it may be, we should infer
that the races which we were comparing had once obeyed
a great system of common institutions of which the Jus
Gentium was the reproduction, and that the complicated
usages of separate commonwealths were only corruptions
and depravations of the simpler ordinances which had once
regulated their primitive state. But the results to which
modern ideas conduct the observer are, as nearly as possible,
the reverse of those which were instinctively brought home to
the primitive Roman. What we respect or admire, he disliked
or regarded with jealous dread. The parts of jurisprudence
which he looked upon with affection were exactly
those which a modern theorist leaves out of consideration
as accidental and transitory; the solemn gestures of the
mancipation; the nicely adjusted questions and answers
of the verbal contract; the endless formalities of pleading
and procedure. The Jus Gentium was merely a system forced
on his attention by a political necessity. He loved it as little
as he loved the foreigners from whose institutions it was
derived and for whose benefit it was intended. A complete
revolution in his ideas was required before it could challenge
his respect, but so complete was it when it did occur, that the
true reason why our modern estimate of the Jus Gentium
differs from that which has just been described, is that both
modern jurisprudence and modern philosophy have inherited
the matured views of the later jurisconsults on this subject.
There did come a time, when from an ignoble appendage of
the Jus Civile, the Jus Gentium came to be considered a great
though as yet imperfectly developed model to which all law
ought as far as possible to conform. This crisis arrived when
the Greek theory of a Law of Nature was applied to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">031</a></span>
practical Roman administration of the Law common to all
Nations.</p>

<p>The Jus Naturale, or Law of Nature, is simply the Jus
Gentium or Law of Nations seen in the light of a peculiar
theory. An unfortunate attempt to discriminate them was
made by the jurisconsult Ulpian, with the propensity to distinguish
characteristic of a lawyer, but the language of Gaius,
a much higher authority, and the passage quoted before from
the Institutes leave no room for doubt, that the expressions
were practically convertible. The difference between them
was entirely historical, and no distinction in essence could
ever be established between them. It is almost unnecessary
to add that the confusion between Jus Gentium, or Law
common to all Nations, and <i>international law</i> is entirely
modern. The classical expression for international law is
Jus Feciale or the law of negotiation and diplomacy. It is,
however, unquestionable that indistinct impressions as to the
meaning of Jus Gentium had considerable share in producing
the modern theory that the relations of independent states
are governed by the Law of Nature.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary to investigate the Greek conceptions
of nature and her law. The word &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;, which was rendered
in the Latin <i>natura</i> and our <i>nature</i>, denoted beyond all doubt
originally the material universe, but it was the material
universe contemplated under an aspect which&mdash;such is our
intellectual distance from those times&mdash;it is not very easy to
delineate in modern language. Nature signified the physical
world regarded as the result of some primordial element or
law. The oldest Greek philosophers had been accustomed to
explain the fabric of creation as the manifestation of some
single principle which they variously asserted to be movement,
force, fire, moisture, or generation. In its simplest and
most ancient sense, Nature is precisely the physical universe
looked upon in this way as the manifestation of a principle.
Afterwards, the later Greek sects, returning to a path from
which the greatest intellects of Greece had meanwhile strayed,
added the <i>moral</i> to the <i>physical</i> world in the conception of
Nature. They extended the term till it embraced not merely
the visible creation, but the thoughts, observances, and aspirations
of mankind. Still, as before, it was not solely the moral
phenomena of human society which they understood by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">032</a></span>
<i>Nature</i>, but these phenomena considered as resolvable into
some general and simple laws.</p>

<p>Now, just as the oldest Greek theorists supposed that the
sports of chance had changed the material universe from its
simple primitive form into its present heterogeneous condition,
so their intellectual descendants imagined that but for
untoward accident the human race would have conformed
itself to simpler rules of conduct and a less tempestuous life.
To live according to <i>nature</i> came to be considered as the end
for which man was created, and which the best men were
bound to compass. To live according to <i>nature</i> was to rise
above the disorderly habits and gross indulgences of the
vulgar to higher laws of action which nothing but self-denial
and self-command would enable the aspirant to observe. It
is notorious that this proposition&mdash;live according to nature&mdash;was
the sum of the tenets of the famous Stoic philosophy.
Now on the subjugation of Greece that philosophy made
instantaneous progress in Roman society. It possessed
natural fascinations for the powerful class who, in theory at
least, adhered to the simple habits of the ancient Italian race,
and disdained to surrender themselves to the innovations of
foreign fashions. Such persons began immediately to affect
the Stoic precepts of life according to nature&mdash;an affectation
all the more grateful, and, I may add, all the more noble,
from its contrast with the unbounded profligacy which was
being diffused through the imperial city by the pillage of the
world and by the example of its most luxurious races. In
the front of the disciples of the new Greek school, we might be
sure, even if we did not know it historically, that the Roman
lawyers figured. We have abundant proof that, there being
substantially but two professions in the Roman republic, the
military men were generally identified with the party of
movement, but the lawyers were universally at the head of
the party of resistance.</p>

<p>The alliance of the lawyers with the Stoic philosophers
lasted through many centuries. Some of the earliest names
in the series of renowned jurisconsults are associated with
Stoicism, and ultimately we have the golden age of Roman
jurisprudence fixed by general consent at the era of the
Antonine C&aelig;sars, the most famous disciples to whom that
philosophy has given a rule of life. The long diffusion of these
doctrines among the members of a particular profession was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">033</a></span>
sure to affect the art which they practised and influenced.
Several positions which we find in the remains of the Roman
jurisconsults are scarcely intelligible, unless we use the Stoic
tenets as our key; but at the same time it is a serious, though
a very common, error to measure the influence of Stoicism
on Roman law by counting up the number of legal rules which
can be confidently affiliated on Stoical dogmas. It has often
been observed that the strength of Stoicism resided not in
its canons of conduct, which were often repulsive or ridiculous,
but in the great though vague principle which it inculcated
of resistance to passion. Just in the same way the influence
on jurisprudence of the Greek theories, which had their most
distinct expression in Stoicism, consisted not in the number
of specific positions which they contributed to Roman law,
but in the single fundamental assumption which they lent
to it. After nature had become a household word in the
mouths of the Romans, the belief gradually prevailed among
the Roman lawyers that the old Jus Gentium was in fact
the lost code of Nature, and that the Pr&aelig;tor in framing an
Edictal jurisprudence on the principles of the Jus Gentium
was gradually restoring a type from which law had only
departed to deteriorate. The inference from this belief was
immediate, that it was the Pr&aelig;tor's duty to supersede the
Civil Law as much as possible by the Edict, to revive as far
as might be the institutions by which Nature had governed
man in the primitive state. Of course, there were many
impediments to the amelioration of law by this agency.
There may have been prejudices to overcome even in
the legal profession itself, and Roman habits were far
too tenacious to give way at once to mere philosophical
theory. The indirect methods by which the Edict combated
certain technical anomalies, show the caution which its
authors were compelled to observe, and down to the very
days of Justinian there was some part of the old law which
had obstinately resisted its influence. But, on the whole, the
progress of the Romans in legal improvement was astonishingly
rapid as soon as stimulus was applied to it by the theory
of Natural Law. The ideas of simplification and generalisation
had always been associated with the conception of Nature;
simplicity, symmetry, and intelligibility came therefore to be
regarded as the characteristics of a good legal system, and
the taste for involved language, multiplied ceremonials, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">034</a></span>
useless difficulties disappeared altogether. The strong will,
and unusual opportunities of Justinian were needed to bring
the Roman law to its existing shape, but the ground plan of
the system had been sketched long before the imperial
reforms were effected.</p>

<p>What was the exact point of contact between the old Jus
Gentium and the Law of Nature? I think that they touch and
blend through &AElig;quitas, or Equity in its original sense; and
here we seem to come to the first appearance in jurisprudence
of this famous term, Equity. In examining an expression
which has so remote an origin and so long a history as this,
it is always safest to penetrate, if possible, to the simple
metaphor or figure which at first shadowed forth the conception.
It has generally been supposed that &AElig;quitas is the
equivalent of the Greek &#7984;&#963;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;, <i>i.e.</i> the principle of equal
or proportionate distribution. The equal division of numbers
or physical magnitudes is doubtless closely entwined with
our perceptions of justice; there are few associations which
keep their ground in the mind so stubbornly or are dismissed
from it with such difficulty by the deepest thinkers. Yet in
tracing the history of this association, it certainly does not
seem to have suggested itself to very early thought, but is
rather the offspring of a comparatively late philosophy. It is
remarkable too that the "equality" of laws on which the
Greek democracies prided themselves&mdash;that equality which,
in the beautiful drinking song of Callistratus, Harmodius and
Aristogiton are said to have given to Athens&mdash;had little in
common with the "equity" of the Romans. The first was
an equal administration of civil laws among the citizens,
however limited the class of citizens might be; the last implied
the applicability of a law, which was not civil law, to a
class which did not necessarily consist of citizens. The first
excluded a despot; the last included foreigners, and for some
purposes slaves. On the whole, I should be disposed to look
in another direction for the germ of the Roman "Equity."
The Latin word "&aelig;quus" carries with it more distinctly than
the Greek "&#7988;&#963;&#959;&#962;" the sense of <i>levelling</i>. Now its levelling
tendency was exactly the characteristic of the Jus Gentium,
which would be most striking to a primitive Roman. The
pure Quiritarian law recognised a multitude of arbitrary
distinctions between classes of men and kinds of property;
the Jus Gentium, generalised from a comparison of various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">035</a></span>
customs, neglected the Quiritarian divisions. The old Roman
law established, for example, a fundamental difference
between "Agnatic" and "Cognatic" relationship, that is,
between the Family considered as based upon common
subjection to patriarchal authority and the Family considered
(in conformity with modern ideas) as united through the mere
fact of a common descent. This distinction disappears in
the "law common to all nations," as also does the difference
between the archaic forms of property, Things "Mancipi"
and Things "nec Mancipi." The neglect of demarcations
and boundaries seems to me, therefore, the feature of the
Jus Gentium which was depicted in &AElig;quitas. I imagine that
the word was at first a mere description of that constant
<i>levelling</i> or removal of irregularities which went on wherever
the pr&aelig;torian system was applied to the cases of foreign
litigants. Probably no colour of ethical meaning belonged at
first to the expression; nor is there any reason to believe
that the process which it indicated was otherwise than extremely
distasteful to the primitive Roman mind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the feature of the Jus Gentium
which was presented to the apprehension of a Roman
by the word Equity, was exactly the first and most
vividly realised characteristic of the hypothetical state of
nature. Nature implied symmetrical order, first in the
physical world, and next in the moral, and the earliest notion
of order doubtless involved straight lines, even surfaces, and
measured distances. The same sort of picture or figure would
be unconsciously before the mind's eye, whether it strove to
form the outlines of the supposed natural state, or whether
it took in at a glance the actual administration of the "law
common to all nations"; and all we know of primitive
thought would lead us to conclude that this ideal similarity
would do much to encourage the belief in an identity of the
two conceptions. But then, while the Jus Gentium had
little or no antecedent credit at Rome, the theory of a
Law of Nature came in surrounded with all the prestige of
philosophical authority, and invested with the charms of
association with an elder and more blissful condition of the
race. It is easy to understand how the difference in the point
of view would affect the dignity of the term which at once
described the operation of the old principles and the results
of the new theory. Even to modern ears it is not at all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">036</a></span>
same thing to describe a process as one of "levelling" and
to call it the "correction of anomalies," though the metaphor
is precisely the same. Nor do I doubt that, when once
&AElig;quitas was understood to convey an allusion to the Greek
theory, associations which grew out of the Greek notion of
&#7984;&#963;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962; began to cluster round it. The language of Cicero
renders it more than likely that this was so, and it was the
first stage of a transmutation of the conception of Equity,
which almost every ethical system which has appeared since
those days has more or less helped to carry on.</p>

<p>Something must be said of the formal instrumentality by
which the principles and distinctions associated, first with the
Law common to all Nations, and afterwards with the Law of
Nature, were gradually incorporated with the Roman law.
At the crisis of primitive Roman history which is marked by
the expulsion of the Tarquins, a change occurred which has
its parallel in the early annals of many ancient states, but
which had little in common with those passages of political
affairs which we now term revolutions. It may best be
described by saying that the monarchy was put into commission.
The powers heretofore accumulated in the hands of
a single person were parcelled out among a number of elective
functionaries, the very name of the kingly office being
retained and imposed on a personage known subsequently as
the Rex Sacrorum or Rex Sacrificulus. As part of the change,
the settled duties of the supreme judicial office devolved on
the Pr&aelig;tor, at the time the first functionary in the commonwealth,
and together with these duties was transferred the
undefined supremacy over law and legislation which always
attached to ancient sovereigns and which is not obscurely
related to the patriarchal and heroic authority they had once
enjoyed. The circumstances of Rome gave great importance
to the more indefinite portion of the functions thus as
transferred, as with the establishment of the republic began
that series of recurrent trials which overtook the state, in
the difficulty of dealing with a multitude of persons who,
not coming within the technical description of indigenous
Romans, were nevertheless permanently located within
Roman jurisdiction. Controversies between such persons, or
between such persons and native-born citizens, would have
remained without the pale of the remedies provided by
Roman law, if the Pr&aelig;tor had not undertaken to decide them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">037</a></span>
and he must soon have addressed himself to the more critical
disputes which in the extension of commerce arose between
Roman subjects and avowed foreigners. The great increase
of such cases in the Roman Courts about the period of the
first Punic War is marked by the appointment of a special
Pr&aelig;tor, known subsequently as the Pr&aelig;tor Peregrinus, who
gave them his undivided attention. Meantime, one precaution
of the Roman people against the revival of oppression, had
consisted in obliging every magistrate whose duties had any
tendency to expand their sphere, to publish, on commencing
his year of office, an Edict or proclamation, in which he
declared the manner in which he intended to administer his
department. The Pr&aelig;tor fell under the rule with other
magistrates; but as it was necessarily impossible to construct
each year a separate system of principles, he seems to
have regularly republished his predecessor's Edict with such
additions and changes as the exigency of the moment or his
own views of the law compelled him to introduce. The
Pr&aelig;tor's proclamation, thus lengthened by a new portion
every year, obtained the name of the Edictum Perpetuum,
that is, the <i>continuous</i> or <i>unbroken</i> edict. The immense
length to which it extended, together perhaps with some
distaste for its necessarily disorderly texture, caused the
practice of increasing it to be stopped in the year of Salvius
Julianus, who occupied the magistracy in the reign of the
Emperor Hadrian. The edict of that Pr&aelig;tor embraced therefore
the whole body of equity jurisprudence, which it probably
disposed in new and symmetrical order, and the perpetual
edict is therefore often cited in Roman law merely as the
Edict of Julianus.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first inquiry which occurs to an Englishman
who considers the peculiar mechanism of the Edict is, what
were the limitations by which these extensive powers of the
Pr&aelig;tor were restrained? How was authority so little definite
reconciled with a settled condition of society and of law?
The answer can only be supplied by careful observation of the
conditions under which our own English law is administered.
The Pr&aelig;tor, it should be recollected, was a jurisconsult himself,
or a person entirely in the hands of advisers who were
jurisconsults, and it is probable that every Roman lawyer
waited impatiently for the time when he should fill or control
the great judicial magistracy. In the interval, his tastes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">038</a></span>
feelings, prejudices, and degree of enlightenment were
inevitably those of his own order, and the qualifications
which he ultimately brought to office were those which he had
acquired in the practice and study of his profession. An
English Chancellor goes through precisely the same training,
and carries to the woolsack the same qualifications. It is
certain when he assumes office that he will have, to some
extent, modified the law before he leaves it; but until he
has quitted his seat, and the series of his decisions in the Law
Reports has been completed, we cannot discover how far
he has elucidated or added to the principles which his predecessors
bequeathed to him. The influence of the Pr&aelig;tor on
Roman jurisprudence differed only in respect of the period
at which its amount was ascertained. As was before stated,
he was in office but for a year, and his decisions rendered
during his year, though of course irreversible as regarded the
litigants, were of no ulterior value. The most natural moment
for declaring the changes he proposed to effect occurred
therefore at his entrance on the pr&aelig;torship, and hence, when
commencing his duties, he did openly and avowedly that
which in the end his English representative does insensibly
and sometimes unconsciously. The checks on this apparent
liberty are precisely those imposed on an English judge.
Theoretically there seems to be hardly any limit to the
powers of either of them, but practically the Roman Pr&aelig;tor,
no less than the English Chancellor, was kept within the
narrowest bounds by the prepossessions imbibed from early
training and by the strong restraints of professional opinion,
restraints of which the stringency can only be appreciated
by those who have personally experienced them. It may be
added that the lines within which movement is permitted,
and beyond which there is to be no travelling, were chalked
with as much distinctness in the one case as in the other.
In England the judge follows the analogies of reported
decisions on insulated groups of facts. At Rome, as the
intervention of the Pr&aelig;tor was at first dictated by simple
concern for the safety of the state, it is likely that in the
earliest times it was proportioned to the difficulty which it
attempted to get rid of. Afterwards, when the taste for
principle had been diffused by the Responses, he no doubt
used the Edict as the means of giving a wider application to
those fundamental principles, which he and the other practising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">039</a></span>
jurisconsults, his contemporaries, believed themselves to
have detected underlying the law. Latterly he acted wholly
under the influence of Greek philosophical theories, which at
once tempted him to advance and confined him to a particular
course of progress.</p>

<p>The nature of the measures attributed to Salvius Julianus
has been much disputed. Whatever they were, their effects
on the Edict are sufficiently plain. It ceased to be extended
by annual additions, and henceforward the equity jurisprudence
of Rome was developed by the labours of a
succession of great jurisconsults who fill with their writings
the interval between the reign of Hadrian and the reign of
Alexander Severus. A fragment of the wonderful system
which they built up survives in the Pandects of Justinian,
and supplies evidence that their works took the form of
treatises on all parts of Roman Law, but chiefly that of
commentaries on the Edict. Indeed, whatever be the immediate
subject of a jurisconsult of this epoch, he may always
be called an expositor of Equity. The principles of the Edict
had, before the epoch of its cessation, made their way into
every part of Roman jurisprudence. The Equity of Rome,
it should be understood, even when most distinct from the
Civil Law, was always administered by the same tribunals.
The Pr&aelig;tor was the chief equity judge as well as the great
common law magistrate, and as soon as the Edict had evolved
an equitable rule the Pr&aelig;tor's court began to apply it in
place of or by the side of the old rule of the Civil Law, which
was thus directly or indirectly repealed without any express
enactment of the legislature. The result, of course, fell considerably
short of a complete fusion of law and equity,
which was not carried out till the reforms of Justinian. The
technical severance of the two elements of jurisprudence
entailed some confusion and some inconvenience, and there
were certain of the stubborner doctrines of the Civil Law with
which neither the authors nor the expositors of the Edict
had ventured to interfere. But at the same time there was
no corner of the field of jurisprudence which was not more
or less swept over by the influence of Equity. It supplied
the jurist with all his materials for generalisation, with all
his methods of interpretation, with his elucidations of first
principles, and with that great mass of limiting rules which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">040</a></span>
rarely interfered with by the legislator, but which seriously
control the application of every legislative act.</p>

<p>The period of jurists ends with Alexander Severus. From
Hadrian to that emperor the improvement of law was carried
on, as it is at the present moment in most continental
countries, partly by approved commentaries and partly by
direct legislation. But in the reign of Alexander Severus the
power of growth in Roman Equity seems to be exhausted,
and the succession of jurisconsults comes to a close. The
remaining history of the Roman law is the history of the
imperial constitutions, and, at the last, of attempts to codify
what had now become the unwieldy body of Roman jurisprudence.
We have the latest and most celebrated experiment
of this kind in the <i>Corpus Juris</i> of Justinian.</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to enter on a detailed comparison
or contrast of English and Roman Equity, but
it may be worth while to mention two features which they
have in common. The first may be stated as follows. Each
of them tended, and all such systems tend, to exactly the
same state in which the old common law was when Equity
first interfered with it. A time always comes at which the
moral principles originally adopted have been carried out
to all their legitimate consequences, and then the system
founded on them becomes as rigid, as unexpansive, and as
liable to fall behind moral progress as the sternest code of
rules avowedly legal. Such an epoch was reached at Rome
in the reign of Alexander Severus; after which, though the
whole Roman world was undergoing a moral revolution, the
Equity of Rome ceased to expand. The same point of legal
history was attained in England under the chancellorship
of Lord Eldon, the first of our equity judges who, instead of
enlarging the jurisprudence of his court by indirect legislation,
devoted himself through life to explaining and harmonising
it. If the philosophy of legal history were better understood
in England, Lord Eldon's services would be less exaggerated
on the one hand and better appreciated on the other than
they appear to be among contemporary lawyers. Other
misapprehensions too, which bear some practical fruit, would
perhaps be avoided. It is easily seen by English lawyers that
English Equity is a system founded on moral rules; but it is
forgotten that these rules are the morality of past centuries&mdash;not
of the present&mdash;that they have received nearly as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">041</a></span>
application as they are capable of, and that though of course
they do not differ largely from the ethical creed of our own
day, they are not necessarily on a level with it. The imperfect
theories of the subject which are commonly adopted have
generated errors of opposite sorts. Many writers of treatises
on Equity, struck with the completeness of the system in its
present state, commit themselves expressly or implicitly to
the paradoxical assertion that the founders of the chancery
jurisprudence contemplated its present fixity of form when
they were settling its first bases. Others, again, complain&mdash;and
this is a grievance frequently observed upon in forensic
arguments&mdash;that the moral rules enforced by the Court of
Chancery fall short of the ethical standard of the present day.
They would have each Lord Chancellor perform precisely
the same office for the jurisprudence which he finds ready to
his hand, which was performed for the old common law by
the fathers of English equity. But this is to invert the order
of the agencies by which the improvement of the law is carried
on. Equity has its place and its time; but I have pointed out
that another instrumentality is ready to succeed it when its
energies are spent.</p>

<p>Another remarkable characteristic of both English and
Roman Equity is the falsehood of the assumptions upon
which the claim of the equitable to superiority over the legal
rule is originally defended. Nothing is more distasteful to
men, either as individuals or as masses, than the admission
of their moral progress as a substantive reality.
This unwillingness shows itself, as regards individuals, in
the exaggerated respect which is ordinarily paid to the
doubtful virtue of consistency. The movement of the
collective opinion of a whole society is too palpable to be
ignored, and is generally too visible for the better to be
decried; but there is the greatest disinclination to accept it
as a primary phenomenon, and it is commonly explained as
the recovery of a lost perfection&mdash;the gradual return to a
state from which the race has lapsed. This tendency to look
backward instead of forward for the goal of moral progress
produced anciently, as we have seen, on Roman jurisprudence
effects the most serious and permanent. The Roman jurisconsults,
in order to account for the improvement of their
jurisprudence by the Pr&aelig;tor, borrowed from Greece the
doctrine of a Natural state of man&mdash;a Natural society&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">042</a></span>
anterior to the organisation of commonwealths governed by
positive laws. In England, on the other hand, a range of
ideas especially congenial to Englishmen of that day, explained
the claim of Equity to override the common law by
supposing a general right to superintend the administration
of justice which was assumed to be vested in the king as a
natural result of his paternal authority. The same view
appears in a different and a quainter form in the old doctrine
that Equity flowed from the king's conscience&mdash;the improvement
which had in fact taken place in the moral standard of
the community being thus referred to an inherent elevation
in the moral sense of the sovereign. The growth of the
English constitution rendered such a theory unpalatable
after a time; but, as the jurisdiction of the Chancery was then
firmly established, it was not worth while to devise any formal
substitute for it. The theories found in modern manuals of
Equity are very various, but all are alike in their untenability.
Most of them are modifications of the Roman doctrine of a
natural law, which is indeed adopted in tenour by those
writers who begin a discussion of the jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery by laying down a distinction between natural
justice and civil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">043</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the modern history of the law of nature</span></h4>


<p>It will be inferred from what has been said that the theory
which transformed the Roman jurisprudence had no claim to
philosophical precision. It involved, in fact, one of those
"mixed modes of thought" which are now acknowledged
to have characterised all but the highest minds during the
infancy of speculation, and which are far from undiscoverable
even in the mental efforts of our own day. The Law of
Nature confused the Past and the Present. Logically, it
implied a state of Nature which had once been regulated by
natural law; yet the jurisconsults do not speak clearly or
confidently of the existence of such a state, which indeed is
little noticed by the ancients except where it finds a poetical
expression in the fancy of a golden age. Natural law, for all
practical purposes, was something belonging to the present,
something entwined with existing institutions, something
which could be distinguished from them by a competent
observer. The test which separated the ordinances of Nature
from the gross ingredients with which they were mingled was
a sense of simplicity and harmony; yet it was not on account
of their simplicity and harmony that these finer elements
were primarily respected, but on the score of their descent
from the aboriginal reign of Nature. This confusion has not
been successfully explained away by the modern disciples
of the jurisconsults, and in truth modern speculations on the
Law of Nature betray much more indistinctness of perception
and are vitiated by much more hopeless ambiguity of
language than the Roman lawyers can be justly charged with.
There are some writers on the subject who attempt to evade
the fundamental difficulty by contending that the code of
Nature exists in the future and is the goal to which all civil
laws are moving, but this is to reverse the assumptions on
which the old theory rested, or rather perhaps to mix together
two inconsistent theories. The tendency to look not to the
past but to the future for types of perfection was brought into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">044</a></span>
the world by Christianity. Ancient literature gives few or no
hints of a belief that the progress of society is necessarily
from worse to better.</p>

<p>But the importance of this theory to mankind has been
very much greater than its philosophical deficiencies would
lead us to expect. Indeed, it is not easy to say what turn the
history of thought, and therefore, of the human race, would
have taken, if the belief in a law natural had not become
universal in the ancient world.</p>

<p>There are two special dangers to which law, and society
which is held together by law, appear to be liable in their
infancy. One of them is that law may be too rapidly
developed. This occurred with the codes of the more progressive
Greek communities, which disembarrassed themselves
with astonishing facility from cumbrous forms of procedure
and needless terms of art, and soon ceased to attach any
superstitious value to rigid rules and prescriptions. It was
not for the ultimate advantage of mankind that they did
so, though the immediate benefit conferred on their citizens
may have been considerable. One of the rarest qualities of
national character is the capacity for applying and working
out the law, as such, at the cost of constant miscarriages of
abstract justice, without at the same time losing the hope or
the wish that law may be conformed to a higher ideal. The
Greek intellect, with all its nobility and elasticity, was quite
unable to confine itself within the strait waistcoat of a legal
formula; and, if we may judge them by the popular courts of
Athens, of whose working we possess accurate knowledge, the
Greek tribunals exhibited the strongest tendency to confound
law and fact. The remains of the Orators and the forensic
commonplaces preserved by Aristotle in his Treatise on
Rhetoric, show that questions of pure law were constantly
argued on every consideration which could possibly influence
the mind of the judges. No durable system of jurisprudence
could be produced in this way. A community which never
hesitated to relax rules of written law whenever they stood
in the way of an ideally perfect decision on the facts of
particular cases, would only, if it bequeathed any body of
judicial principles to posterity, bequeath one consisting of
the ideas of right and wrong which happened to be prevalent
at the time. Such a jurisprudence would contain no framework
to which the more advanced conceptions of subsequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">045</a></span>
ages could be fitted. It would amount at best to a philosophy
marked with the imperfections of the civilisation under which
it grew up.</p>

<p>Few national societies have had their jurisprudence
menaced by this peculiar danger of precocious maturity and
untimely disintegration. It is certainly doubtful whether
the Romans were ever seriously threatened by it, but at any
rate they had adequate protection in their theory of Natural
Law. For the Natural Law of the jurisconsults was distinctly
conceived by them as a system which ought gradually
to absorb civil laws, without superseding them so long as
they remained unrepealed. There was no such impression
of its sanctity abroad, that an appeal to it would be likely
to overpower the mind of a judge who was charged with the
superintendence of a particular litigation. The value and
serviceableness of the conception arose from its keeping
before the mental vision a type of perfect law, and from its
inspiring the hope of an indefinite approximation to it, at
the same time that it never tempted the practitioner or the
citizen to deny the obligation of existing laws which had not
yet been adjusted to the theory. It is important too to
observe that this model system, unlike many of those which
have mocked men's hopes in later days, was not entirely the
product of imagination. It was never thought of as founded
on quite untested principles. The notion was that it underlay
existing law and must be looked for through it. Its
functions were in short remedial, not revolutionary or
anarchical. And this, unfortunately, is the exact point at
which the modern view of a Law of Nature has often ceased
to resemble the ancient.</p>

<p>The other liability to which the infancy of society is exposed
has prevented or arrested the progress of far the greater part
of mankind. The rigidity of primitive law, arising chiefly
from its early association and identification with religion,
has chained down the mass of the human race to those views
of life and conduct which they entertained at the time when
their usages were first consolidated into a systematic form.
There were one or two races exempted by a marvellous fate
from this calamity, and grafts from these stocks have fertilised
a few modern societies, but it is still true that, over the larger
part of the world, the perfection of law has always been
considered as consisting in adherence to the ground plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">046</a></span>
supposed to have been marked out by the original legislator.
If intellect has in such cases been exercised on jurisprudence,
it has uniformly prided itself on the subtle perversity of the
conclusions it could build on ancient texts, without discoverable
departure from their literal tenour. I know no reason
why the law of the Romans should be superior to the laws
of the Hindoos, unless the theory of Natural Law had given
it a type of excellence different from the usual one. In this
one exceptional instance, simplicity and symmetry were
kept before the eyes of a society whose influence on mankind
was destined to be prodigious from other causes, as the
characteristics of an ideal and absolutely perfect law. It is
impossible to overrate the importance to a nation or profession
of having a distinct object to aim at in the pursuit of
improvement. The secret of Bentham's immense influence in
England during the past thirty years is his success in placing
such an object before the country. He gave us a clear rule
of reform. English lawyers of the last century were probably
too acute to be blinded by the paradoxical commonplace that
English law was the perfection of human reason, but they
acted as if they believed it for want of any other principle
to proceed upon. Bentham made the good of the community
take precedence of every other object, and thus gave escape
to a current which had long been trying to find its way
outwards.</p>

<p>It is not an altogether fanciful comparison if we call the
assumptions we have been describing the ancient counterpart
of Benthamism. The Roman theory guided men's efforts
in the same direction as the theory put into shape by the
Englishman; its practical results were not widely different
from those which would have been attained by a sect of law-reformers
who maintained a steady pursuit of the general
good of the community. It would be a mistake, however,
to suppose it a conscious anticipation of Bentham's principles.
The happiness of mankind is, no doubt, sometimes assigned,
both in the popular and in the legal literature of the Romans,
as the proper object of remedial legislation, but it is very
remarkable how few and faint are the testimonies to this
principle compared with the tributes which are constantly
offered to the overshadowing claims of the Law of Nature.
It was not to anything resembling philanthropy, but to their
sense of simplicity and harmony&mdash;of what they significantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">047</a></span>
termed "elegance"&mdash;that the Roman jurisconsults freely
surrendered themselves. The coincidence of their labours
with those which a more precise philosophy would have
counselled has been part of the good fortune of mankind.</p>

<p>Turning to the modern history of the law of nature, we
find it easier to convince ourselves of the vastness of its
influence than to pronounce confidently whether that influence
has been exerted for good or for evil. The doctrines and
institutions which may be attributed to it are the material
of some of the most violent controversies debated in our time,
as will be seen when it is stated that the theory of Natural
Law is the source of almost all the special ideas as to law,
politics, and society which France during the last hundred
years has been the instrument of diffusing over the western
world. The part played by jurists in French history, and the
sphere of jural conceptions in French thought, have always
been remarkably large. It was not indeed in France, but
in Italy, that the juridical science of modern Europe took its
rise, but of the schools founded by emissaries of the Italian
universities in all parts of the continent, and attempted
(though vainly) to be set up in our island, that established
in France produced the greatest effect on the fortunes of
the country. The lawyers of France immediately formed a
strict alliance with the kings of the house of Capet, and it was
as much through their assertions of royal prerogative, and
through their interpretations of the rules of feudal succession,
as by the power of the sword, that the French monarchy at
last grew together out of the agglomeration of provinces and
dependencies. The enormous advantage which their understanding
with the lawyers conferred on the French kings in
the prosecution of their struggle with the great feudatories,
the aristocracy, and the church, can only be appreciated if
we take into account the ideas which prevailed in Europe far
down into the middle ages. There was, in the first place, a
great enthusiasm for generalisation and a curious admiration
for all general propositions, and consequently, in the field
of law, an involuntary reverence for every general formula
which seemed to embrace and sum up a number of the
insulated rules which were practised as usages in various
localities. Such general formulas it was, of course, not
difficult for practitioners familiar with the Corpus Juris or
the Glosses to supply in almost any quantity. There was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">048</a></span>
however, another cause which added yet more considerably
to the lawyers' power. At the period of which we are speaking,
there was universal vagueness of ideas as to the degree
and nature of the authority residing in written texts of law.
For the most part, the peremptory preface, <i>Ita scriptum est</i>,
seems to have been sufficient to silence all objections. Where
a mind of our own day would jealously scrutinise the formula
which had been quoted, would inquire its source, and would
(if necessary) deny that the body of law to which it belonged
had any authority to supersede local customs, the elder jurist
would not probably have ventured to do more than question
the applicability of the rule, or at best cite some counter
proposition from the Pandects or the Canon Law. It is
extremely necessary to bear in mind the uncertainty of men's
notions on this most important side of juridical controversies,
not only because it helps to explain the weight which the
lawyers threw into the monarchical scale, but on account of
the light which it sheds on several curious historical problems.
The motives of the author of the Forged Decretals and his
extraordinary success are rendered more intelligible by it.
And, to take a phenomenon of smaller interest, it assists us,
though only partially, to understand the plagiarisms of
Bracton. That an English writer of the time of Henry III.
should have been able to put off on his countrymen as a
compendium of pure English law a treatise of which the entire
form and a third of the contents were directly borrowed from
the Corpus Juris, and that he should have ventured on this
experiment in a country where the systematic study of the
Roman law was formally proscribed, will always be among
the most hopeless enigmas in the history of jurisprudence;
but still it is something to lessen our surprise when we comprehend
the state of opinion at the period as to the obligatory
force of written texts, apart from all consideration of the
source whence they were derived.</p>

<p>When the kings of France had brought their long struggle
for supremacy to a successful close, an epoch which may
be placed roughly at the accession of the branch of Valois-Angoul&ecirc;me
to the throne, the situation of the French jurists
was peculiar and continued to be so down to the outbreak
of the revolution. On the one hand, they formed the best
instructed and nearly the most powerful class in the nation.
They had made good their footing as a privileged order by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">049</a></span>
the side of the feudal aristocracy, and they had assured their
influence by an organisation which distributed their profession
over France in great chartered corporations possessing large
defined powers and still larger indefinite claims. In all
the qualities of the advocate, the judge, and the legislator,
they far excelled their compeers throughout Europe. Their
juridical tact, their ease of expression, their fine sense of
analogy and harmony, and (if they may be judged by the
highest names among them) their passionate devotion to
their conceptions of justice, were as remarkable as the
singular variety of talent which they included, a variety
covering the whole ground between the opposite poles of
Cujas and Montesquieu, of D'Aguesseau and Dumoulin.
But, on the other hand, the system of laws which they had to
administer stood in striking contrast with the habits of mind
which they had cultivated. The France which had been in
great part constituted by their efforts was smitten with the
curse of an anomalous and dissonant jurisprudence beyond
every other country in Europe. One great division ran
through the country and separated it into <i>Pays du Droit
Ecrit</i> and <i>Pays du Droit Coutumier</i>, the first acknowledging
the written Roman law as the basis of their jurisprudence,
the last admitting it only so far as it supplied general forms
of expression, and courses of juridical reasoning which were
reconcileable with the local usages. The sections thus formed
were again variously subdivided. In the <i>Pays du Droit
Coutumier</i> province differed from province, county from
county, municipality from municipality, in the nature of its
customs. In the <i>Pays du Droit Ecrit</i> the stratum of feudal
rules which overlay the Roman law was of the most miscellaneous
composition. No such confusion as this ever existed
in England. In Germany it did exist, but was too much
in harmony with the deep political and religious divisions of
the country to be lamented or even felt. It was the special
peculiarity of France that an extraordinary diversity of laws
continued without sensible alteration while the central
authority of the monarchy was constantly strengthening
itself, while rapid approaches were being made to complete
administrative unity, and while a fervid national spirit had
been developed among the people. The contrast was one
which fructified in many serious results, and among them we
must rank the effect which it produced on the minds of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">050</a></span>
French lawyers. Their speculative opinions and their intellectual
bias were in the strongest opposition to their interests and
professional habits. With the keenest sense and the fullest
recognition of those perfections of jurisprudence which consist
in simplicity and uniformity, they believed, or seemed to
believe, that the vices which actually infested French law
were ineradicable; and in practice they often resisted the
reformation of abuses with an obstinacy which was not shown
by many among their less enlightened countrymen. But
there was a way to reconcile these contradictions. They
became passionate enthusiasts for Natural Law. The Law
of Nature overleapt all provincial and municipal boundaries;
it disregarded all distinctions between noble and burgess,
between burgess and peasant; it gave the most exalted place
to lucidity, simplicity and system; but it committed its
devotees to no specific improvement, and did not directly
threaten any venerable or lucrative technicality. Natural
law may be said to have become the common law of France,
or, at all events, the admission of its dignity and claims
was the one tenet which all French practitioners alike subscribed
to. The language of the pr&aelig;-revolutionary jurists
in its eulogy is singularly unqualified, and it is remarkable
that the writers on the Customs, who often made it their duty
to speak disparagingly of the pure Roman law, speak even
more fervidly of Nature and her rules than the civilians who
professed an exclusive respect for the Digest and the Code.
Dumoulin, the highest of all authorities on old French
Customary Law, has some extravagant passages on the Law
of Nature; and his panegyrics have a peculiar rhetorical
turn which indicated a considerable departure from the
caution of the Roman jurisconsults. The hypothesis of a
Natural Law had become not so much a theory guiding
practice as an article of speculative faith, and accordingly
we shall find that, in the transformation which it more recently
underwent, its weakest parts rose to the level of its strongest
in the esteem of its supporters.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century was half over when the most
critical period in the history of Natural Law was reached.
Had the discussion of the theory and of its consequences
continued to be exclusively the employment of the legal
profession, there would possibly have been an abatement of
the respect which it commanded; for by this time the <i>Esprit des Lois</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">051</a></span>
had appeared. Bearing in some exaggerations the
marks of the excessive violence with which its author's mind
had recoiled from assumptions usually suffered to pass without
scrutiny, yet showing in some ambiguities the traces of a
desire to compromise with existing prejudice, the book of
Montesquieu, with all its defects, still proceeded on that
Historical Method before which the Law of Nature has
never maintained its footing for an instant. Its influence on
thought ought to have been as great as its general popularity;
but, in fact, it was never allowed time to put it forth, for
the counter-hypothesis which it seemed destined to destroy
passed suddenly from the forum to the street, and became the
key-note of controversies far more exciting than are ever
agitated in the courts or the schools. The person who
launched it on its new career was that remarkable man who,
without learning, with few virtues, and with no strength of
character, has nevertheless stamped himself ineffaceably on
history by the force of a vivid imagination, and by the help
of a genuine and burning love for his fellow-men, for which
much will always have to be forgiven him. We have never
seen in our own generation&mdash;indeed the world has not seen
more than once or twice in all the course of history&mdash;a literature
which has exercised such prodigious influence over the
minds of men, over every cast and shade of intellect, as that
which emanated from Rousseau between 1749 and 1762. It
was the first attempt to re-erect the edifice of human belief
after the purely iconoclastic efforts commenced by Bayle, and
in part by our own Locke, and consummated by Voltaire;
and besides the superiority which every constructive effort
will always enjoy over one that is merely destructive, it
possessed the immense advantage of appearing amid an all
but universal scepticism as to the soundness of all foregone
knowledge in matters speculative. Now, in all the speculations
of Rousseau, the central figure, whether arrayed in an
English dress as the signatory of a social compact, or simply
stripped naked of all historical qualities, is uniformly Man,
in a supposed state of nature. Every law or institution
which would misbeseem this imaginary being under these
ideal circumstances is to be condemned as having lapsed
from an original perfection; every transformation of society
which would give it a closer resemblance to the world over
which the creature of Nature reigned, is admirable and worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">052</a></span>
to be effected at any apparent cost. The theory is still that
of the Roman lawyers, for in the phantasmagoria with which
the Natural Condition is peopled, every feature and characteristic
eludes the mind except the simplicity and harmony which
possessed such charms for the jurisconsult; but the theory
is, as it were, turned upside down. It is not the Law of
Nature, but the State of Nature, which is now the primary
subject of contemplation. The Roman had conceived that
by careful observation of existing institutions parts of them
could be singled out which either exhibited already, or could
by judicious purification be made to exhibit, the vestiges of
that reign of nature whose reality he faintly affirmed. Rousseau's
belief was that a perfect social order could be evolved
from the unassisted consideration of the natural state, a social
order wholly irrespective of the actual condition of the world
and wholly unlike it. The great difference between the views
is that one bitterly and broadly condemns the present for
its unlikeness to the ideal past; while the other, assuming the
present to be as necessary as the past, does not affect to disregard
or censure it. It is not worth our while to analyse
with any particularity that philosophy of politics, art,
education, ethics, and social relation which was constructed
on the basis of a state of nature. It still possesses singular
fascination for the looser thinkers of every country, and is
no doubt the parent, more or less remote, of almost all the
prepossessions which impede the employment of the Historical
Method of inquiry, but its discredit with the higher minds
of our day is deep enough to astonish those who are familiar
with the extraordinary vitality of speculative error. Perhaps
the question most frequently asked nowadays is not
what is the value of these opinions, but what were the causes
which gave them such overshadowing prominence a hundred
years ago. The answer is, I conceive, a simple one. The
study which in the last century would best have corrected
the misapprehensions into which an exclusive attention to
legal antiquities is apt to betray was the study of religion.
But Greek religion, as then understood, was dissipated in
imaginative myths. The Oriental religions, if noticed at all,
appeared to be lost in vain cosmogonies. There was but one
body of primitive records which was worth studying&mdash;the
early history of the Jews. But resort to this was prevented
by the prejudices of the time. One of the few characteristics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">053</a></span>
which the school of Rousseau had in common with the school
of Voltaire was an utter disdain of all religious antiquities;
and, more than all, of those of the Hebrew race. It is well
known that it was a point of honour with the reasoners of
that day to assume not merely that the institutions called
after Moses were not divinely dictated, nor even that they
were codified at a later date than that attributed to them,
but that they and the entire Pentateuch were a gratuitous
forgery, executed after the return from the Captivity. Debarred,
therefore, from one chief security against speculative
delusion, the philosophers of France, in their eagerness to
escape from what they deemed a superstition of the priests,
flung themselves headlong into a superstition of the lawyers.</p>

<p>But though the philosophy founded on the hypothesis of
a state of nature has fallen low in general esteem, in so far
as it is looked upon under its coarser and more palpable
aspect, it does not follow that in its subtler disguises it has
lost plausibility, popularity, or power. I believe, as I have
said, that it is still the great antagonist of the Historical
Method; and whenever (religious objections apart) any mind
is seen to resist or contemn that mode of investigation, it
will generally be found under the influence of a prejudice or
vicious bias traceable to a conscious or unconscious reliance
on a non-historic, natural, condition of society or the
individual. It is chiefly, however, by allying themselves with
political and social tendencies that the doctrines of Nature
and her law have preserved their energy. Some of these
tendencies they have stimulated, others they have actually
created, to a great number they have given expression and
form. They visibly enter largely into the ideas which
constantly radiate from France over the civilised world, and
thus become part of the general body of thought by which
its civilisation is modified. The value of the influence which
they thus exercise over the fortunes of the race is of course
one of the points which our age debates most warmly, and
it is beside the purpose of this treatise to discuss it. Looking
back, however, to the period at which the theory of the state
of nature acquired the maximum of political importance,
there are few who will deny that it helped most powerfully
to bring about the grosser disappointments of which the first
French Revolution was fertile. It gave birth, or intense
stimulus, to the vices of mental habit all but universal at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">054</a></span>
time, disdain of positive law, impatience of experience, and
the preference of <i>&agrave; priori</i> to all other reasoning. In proportion
too as this philosophy fixes its grasp on minds which
have thought less than others and fortified themselves with
smaller observation, its tendency is to become distinctly anarchical.
It is surprising to note how many of the <i>Sophismes
Anarchiques</i> which Dumont published for Bentham, and
which embody Bentham's exposure of errors distinctively
French, are derived from the Roman hypothesis in its French
transformation, and are unintelligible unless referred to it.
On this point too it is a curious exercise to consult the <i>Moniteur</i>
during the principal eras of the Revolution. The appeals
to the Law and State of Nature become thicker as the times
grow darker. They are comparatively rare in the Constituent
Assembly; they are much more frequent in the Legislative;
in the Convention, amid the din of debate on conspiracy and
war, they are perpetual.</p>

<p>There is a single example which very strikingly illustrates
the effects of the theory of natural law on modern society,
and indicates how very far are those effects from being
exhausted. There cannot, I conceive, be any question that
to the assumption of a Law Natural we owe the doctrine
of the fundamental equality of human beings. That "all
men are equal" is one of a large number of legal propositions
which, in progress of time, have become political. The
Roman jurisconsults of the Antonine era lay down that
"omnes homines natur&acirc; &aelig;quales sunt," but in their eyes
this is a strictly juridical axiom. They intend to affirm that,
under the hypothetical Law of Nature, and in so far as positive
law approximates to it, the arbitrary distinctions which the
Roman Civil Law maintained between classes of persons
cease to have a legal existence. The rule was one of considerable
importance to the Roman practitioner, who required
to be reminded that, wherever Roman jurisprudence was
assumed to conform itself exactly to the code of Nature, there
was no difference in the contemplation of the Roman tribunals
between citizen and foreigner, between freeman and slave,
between Agnate and Cognate. The jurisconsults who thus
expressed themselves most certainly never intended to censure
the social arrangements under which civil law fell somewhat
short of its speculative type; nor did they apparently believe
that the world would ever see human society completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">055</a></span>
assimilated to the economy of nature. But when the doctrine
of human equality makes its appearance in a modern dress
it has evidently clothed itself with a new shade of meaning.
Where the Roman jurisconsult had written "&aelig;quales sunt,"
meaning exactly what he said, the modern civilian wrote
"all men are equal" in the sense of "all men ought to be
equal." The peculiar Roman idea that natural law coexisted
with civil law and gradually absorbed it, had evidently been
lost sight of, or had become unintelligible, and the words
which had at most conveyed a theory concerning the origin,
composition, and development of human institutions, were
beginning to express the sense of a great standing wrong
suffered by mankind. As early as the beginning of the fourteenth
century, the current language concerning the birth-state
of men, though visibly intended to be identical with that
of Ulpian and his contemporaries, has assumed an altogether
different form and meaning. The preamble to the celebrated
ordinance of King Louis Hutin enfranchising the serfs of
the royal domains would have sounded strangely to Roman
ears. "Whereas, according to natural law, everybody ought
to be born free; and by some usages and customs which,
from long antiquity, have been introduced and kept until
now in our realm, and peradventure by reason of the misdeeds
of their predecessors, many persons of our common people
have fallen into servitude, therefore, We, etc." This is the
enunciation not of a legal rule but of a political dogma; and
from this time the equality of men is spoken of by the French
lawyers just as if it were a political truth which happened to
have been preserved among the archives of their science.
Like all other deductions from the hypothesis of a Law
Natural, and like the belief itself in a Law of Nature, it was
languidly assented to and suffered to have little influence on
opinion and practice until it passed out of the possession of
the lawyers into that of the literary men of the eighteenth
century and of the public which sat at their feet. With them
it became the most distinct tenet of their creed, and was
even regarded as a summary of all the others. It is probable,
however, that the power which it ultimately acquired over
the events of 1789 was not entirely owing to its popularity
in France, for in the middle of the century it passed over to
America. The American lawyers of the time, and particularly
those of Virginia, appear to have possessed a stock of know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">056</a></span>ledge
which differed chiefly from that of their English contemporaries
in including much which could only have been
derived from the legal literature of continental Europe. A
very few glances at the writings of Jefferson will show how
strongly his mind was affected by the semi-juridical, semi-popular
opinions which were fashionable in France, and we
cannot doubt that it was sympathy with the peculiar ideas
of the French jurists which led him and the other colonial
lawyers who guided the course of events in America to join
the specially French assumption that "all men are born
equal" with the assumption, more familiar to Englishmen,
that "all men are born free," in the very first lines of
their Declaration of Independence. The passage was one
of great importance to the history of the doctrine before us.
The American lawyers, in thus prominently and emphatically
affirming the fundamental equality of human beings, gave
an impulse to political movements in their own country, and
in a less degree in Great Britain, which is far from having yet
spent itself; but besides this they returned the dogma they
had adopted to its home in France, endowed with vastly
greater energy and enjoying much greater claims on general
reception and respect. Even the more cautious politicians
of the first Constituent Assembly repeated Ulpian's proposition
as if it at once commended itself to the instincts and
intuitions of mankind; and of all the "principles of 1789"
it is the one which has been least strenuously assailed, which
has most thoroughly leavened modern opinion, and which
promises to modify most deeply the constitution of societies
and the politics of states.</p>

<p>The grandest function of the Law of Nature was discharged
in giving birth to modern International Law and to the modern
Law of War, but this part of its effects must here be dismissed
with consideration very unequal to its importance.</p>

<p>Among the postulates which form the foundation of International
Law, or of so much of it as retains the figure which
it received from its original architects, there are two or three
of pre-eminent importance. The first of all is expressed in
the position that there is a determinable Law of Nature.
Grotius and his successors took the assumption directly
from the Romans, but they differed widely from the Roman
jurisconsults and from each other in their ideas as to the mode
of determination. The ambition of almost every Publicist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">057</a></span>
who has flourished since the revival of letters has been to
provide new and more manageable definitions of Nature
and of her law, and it is indisputable that the conception in
passing through the long series of writers on Public Law has
gathered round it a large accretion, consisting of fragments
of ideas derived from nearly every theory of ethics which has
in its turn taken possession of the schools. Yet it is a remarkable
proof of the essentially historical character of the conception
that, after all the efforts which have been made to
evolve the code of nature from the necessary characteristics
of the natural state, so much of the result is just what it would
have been if men had been satisfied to adopt the dicta of
the Roman lawyers without questioning or reviewing them.
Setting aside the Conventional or Treaty Law of Nations, it
is surprising how large a part of the system is made up of pure
Roman law. Wherever there is a doctrine of the jurisconsults
affirmed by them to be in harmony with the Jus Gentium,
the publicists have found a reason for borrowing it, however
plainly it may bear the marks of a distinctively Roman
origin. We may observe too that the derivative theories
are afflicted with the weakness of the primary notion. In
the majority of the Publicists, the mode of thought is still
"mixed." In studying these writers, the great difficulty
is always to discover whether they are discussing law or
morality&mdash;whether the state of international relations they
describe is actual or ideal&mdash;whether they lay down that which
is, or that which, in their opinion, ought to be.</p>

<p>The assumption that Natural Law is binding on states
<i>inter se</i> is the next in rank of those which underlie International
Law. A series of assertions or admissions of this
principle may be traced up to the very infancy of modern
juridical science, and at first sight it seems a direct inference
from the teaching of the Romans. The civil condition of
society being distinguished from the natural by the fact that
in the first there is a distinct author of law, while in the last
there is none, it appears as if the moment a number of <i>units</i>
were acknowledged to obey no common sovereign or political
superior they were thrown back on the ulterior behests of
the Law Natural. States are such units; the hypothesis of
their independence excludes the notion of a common lawgiver,
and draws with it, therefore, according to a certain range of
ideas, the notion of subjection to the primeval order of nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">058</a></span>
The alternative is to consider independent communities as
not related to each other by any law, but this condition of
lawlessness is exactly the vacuum which the Nature of the
jurisconsults abhorred. There is certainly apparent reason
for thinking that if the mind of a Roman lawyer rested on any
sphere from which civil law was banished, it would instantly
fill the void with the ordinances of Nature. It is never safe,
however, to assume that conclusions, however certain and
immediate in our own eyes, were actually drawn at any period
of history. No passage has ever been adduced from the
remains of Roman law which, in my judgment, proves the
jurisconsults to have believed natural law to have obligatory
force between independent commonwealths; and we cannot
but see that to citizens of the Roman empire who regarded
their sovereign's dominions as conterminous with civilisation,
the equal subjection of states to the Law of Nature, if contemplated
at all, must have seemed at most an extreme result
of curious speculation. The truth appears to be that modern
International Law, undoubted as is its descent from Roman
law, is only connected with it by an irregular filiation. The
early modern interpreters of the jurisprudence of Rome,
misconceiving the meaning of Jus Gentium, assumed without
hesitation that the Romans had bequeathed to them a
system of rules for the adjustment of international transactions.
This "Law of Nations" was at first an authority
which had formidable competitors to strive with, and the
condition of Europe was long such as to preclude its universal
reception. Gradually, however, the western world
arranged itself in a form more favourable to the theory of
the civilians; circumstances destroyed the credit of rival
doctrines; and at last, at a peculiarly felicitous conjuncture,
Ayala and Grotius were able to obtain for it the enthusiastic
assent of Europe, an assent which has been over and over again
renewed in every variety of solemn engagement. The great
men to whom its triumph is chiefly owing attempted, it need
scarcely be said, to place it on an entirely new basis, and it is
unquestionable that in the course of this displacement they
altered much of its structure, though far less of it than is
commonly supposed. Having adopted from the Antonine
jurisconsults the position that the Jus Gentium and the Jus
Natur&aelig; were identical, Grotius, with his immediate predecessors
and his immediate successors, attributed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">059</a></span>
Law of Nature an authority which would never perhaps have
been claimed for it, if "Law of Nations" had not in that age
been an ambiguous expression. They laid down unreservedly
that Natural Law is the code of states, and thus put in operation
a process which has continued almost down to our own
day, the process of engrafting on the international system
rules which are supposed to have been evolved from the
unassisted contemplation of the conception of Nature. There
is too one consequence of immense practical importance to
mankind which, though not unknown during the early modern
history of Europe, was never clearly or universally acknowledged
till the doctrines of the Grotian school had prevailed.
If the society of nations is governed by Natural Law, the
atoms which compose it must be absolutely equal. Men
under the sceptre of Nature are all equal, and accordingly
commonwealths are equal if the international state be one
of nature. The proposition that independent communities,
however different in size and power, are all equal in the view
of the law of nations, has largely contributed to the happiness
of mankind, though it is constantly threatened by the political
tendencies of each successive age. It is a doctrine which
probably would never have obtained a secure footing at all
if International Law had not been entirely derived from the
majestic claims of Nature by the Publicists who wrote after
the revival of letters.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is astonishing, as I have observed
before, how small a proportion the additions made to International
Law since Grotius's day bear to the ingredients
which have been simply taken from the most ancient stratum
of the Roman Jus Gentium. Acquisition of territory has
always been the great spur of national ambition, and the
rules which govern this acquisition, together with the rules
which moderate the wars in which it too frequently results,
are merely transcribed from the part of the Roman law which
treats of the modes of acquiring property <i>jure gentium</i>. These
modes of acquisition were obtained by the elder jurisconsults,
as I have attempted to explain, by abstracting a common
ingredient from the usages observed to prevail among the
various tribes surrounding Rome; and, having been classed
on account of their origin in the "law common to all nations,"
they were thought by the later lawyers to fit in, on the score
of their simplicity, with the more recent conception of a Law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">060</a></span>
Natural. They thus made their way into the modern Law of
Nations, and the result is that those parts of the international
system which refer to <i>dominion</i>, its nature, its limitations, the
modes of acquiring and securing it, are pure Roman Property
Law&mdash;so much, that is to say, of the Roman Law of Property
as the Antonine jurisconsults imagined to exhibit a certain
congruity with the natural state. In order that these chapters
of International Law may be capable of application, it is necessary
that sovereigns should be related to each other like the
members of a group of Roman proprietors. This is another of
the postulates which lie at the threshold of the International
Code, and it is also one which could not possibly have been
subscribed to during the first centuries of modern European
history. It is resolvable into the double proposition that
"sovereignty is territorial," <i>i.e.</i> that it is always associated
with the proprietorship of a limited portion of the
earth's surface, and that "sovereigns <i>inter se</i> are to be
deemed not <i>paramount</i>, but <i>absolute</i>, owners of the state's
territory."</p>

<p>Many contemporary writers on International Law tacitly
assume that the doctrines of their system, founded on principles
of equity and common sense, were capable of being
readily reasoned out in every stage of modern civilisation.
But this assumption, while it conceals some real defects of the
international theory, is altogether untenable, so far as regards
a large part of modern history. It is not true that the authority
of the Jus Gentium in the concerns of nations was always uncontradicted;
on the contrary, it had to struggle long against
the claims of several competing systems. It is again not true
that the territorial character of sovereignty was always recognised,
for long after the dissolution of the Roman dominion
the minds of men were under the empire of ideas irreconcileable
with such a conception. An old order of things, and of
views founded on it, had to decay&mdash;a new Europe, and an
apparatus of new notions congenial to it, had to spring up&mdash;before
two of the chiefest postulates of International Law
could be universally conceded.</p>

<p>It is a consideration well worthy to be kept in view, that
during a large part of what we usually term modern history
no such conception was entertained as that of "<i>territorial
sovereignty</i>." Sovereignty was not associated with dominion
over a portion or subdivision of the earth. The world had lain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">061</a></span>
for so many centuries under the shadow of Imperial Rome as
to have forgotten that distribution of the vast spaces comprised
in the empire which had once parcelled them out into
a number of independent commonwealths, claiming immunity
from extrinsic interference, and pretending to equality of
national rights. After the subsidence of the barbarian irruptions,
the notion of sovereignty that prevailed seems to have
been twofold. On the one hand it assumed the form of what
may be called "<i>tribe</i>-sovereignty." The Franks, the Burgundians,
the Vandals, the Lombards, and Visigoths were
masters, of course, of the territories which they occupied,
and to which some of them have given a geographical
appellation; but they based no claim of right upon the fact
of territorial possession, and indeed attached no importance
to it whatever. They appear to have retained the traditions
which they brought with them from the forest and the steppe,
and to have still been in their own view a patriarchal society,
a nomad horde, merely encamped for the time upon the soil
which afforded them sustenance. Part of Transalpine Gaul,
with part of Germany, had now become the country <i>de facto</i>
occupied by the Franks&mdash;it was France; but the Merovingian
line of chieftains, the descendants of Clovis, were not Kings
of France, they were Kings of the Franks. The alternative
to this peculiar notion of sovereignty appears to have been&mdash;and
this is the important point&mdash;the idea of universal
dominion. The moment a monarch departed from the special
relation of chief to clansmen, and became solicitous, for purposes
of his own, to invest himself with a novel form of sovereignty,
the only precedent which suggested itself for his
adoption was the domination of the Emperors of Rome. To
parody a common quotation, he became "<i>aut C&aelig;sar aut
nullus</i>." Either he pretended to the full prerogative of the
Byzantine Emperor, or he had no political status whatever.
In our own age, when a new dynasty is desirous of obliterating
the prescriptive title of a deposed line of sovereigns, it takes
its designation from the <i>people</i>, instead of the <i>territory</i>. Thus
we have Emperors and Kings of the French, and a King of
the Belgians. At the period of which we have been speaking,
under similar circumstances a different alternative presented
itself. The Chieftain who would no longer call himself King
of the tribe must claim to be Emperor of the world. Thus,
when the hereditary Mayors of the Palace had ceased to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">062</a></span>
compromise with the monarchs they had long since virtually
dethroned, they soon became unwilling to call themselves
Kings of the Franks, a title which belonged to the displaced
Merovings; but they could not style themselves Kings of
France, for such a designation, though apparently not unknown,
was not a title of dignity. Accordingly they came
forward as aspirants to universal empire. Their motive has
been greatly misapprehended. It has been taken for granted
by recent French writers that Charlemagne was far before his
age, quite as much in the character of his designs as in the
energy with which he prosecuted them. Whether it be true or
not that anybody is at any time before his age, it is certainly
true that Charlemagne, in aiming at an unlimited dominion,
was emphatically taking the only course which the characteristic
ideas of his age permitted him to follow. Of his
intellectual eminence there cannot be a question, but it is
proved by his acts and not by his theory.</p>

<p>These singularities of view were not altered on the partition
of the inheritance of Charlemagne among his three grandsons.
Charles the Bald, Lewis, and Lothair were still theoretically&mdash;if
it be proper to use the word&mdash;Emperors of Rome. Just
as the C&aelig;sars of the Eastern and Western Empires had each
been <i>de jure</i> emperor of the whole world, with <i>de facto</i> control
over half of it, so the three Carlovingians appear to have considered
their power as limited, but their title as unqualified.
The same speculative universality of sovereignty continued
to be associated with the Imperial throne after the second
division on the death of Charles the Fat, and, indeed, was
never thoroughly dissociated from it so long as the empire of
Germany lasted. Territorial sovereignty&mdash;the view which
connects sovereignty with the possession of a limited portion
of the earth's surface&mdash;was distinctly an offshoot, though a
tardy one, of <i>feudalism</i>. This might have been expected <i>&agrave;
priori</i>, for it was feudalism which for the first time linked
personal duties, and by consequence personal rights, to the
ownership of land. Whatever be the proper view of its origin
and legal nature, the best mode of vividly picturing to ourselves
the feudal organisation is to begin with the basis, to
consider the relation of the tenant to the patch of soil which
created and limited his services&mdash;and then to mount up,
through narrowing circles of super-feudation, till we approximate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">063</a></span>
to the apex of the system. Where that summit exactly
was during the later portion of the dark ages it is not easy to
decide. Probably, wherever the conception of tribe sovereignty
had really decayed, the topmost point was always
assigned to the supposed successor of the C&aelig;sars of the West.
But before long, when the actual sphere of Imperial authority
had immensely contracted, and when the emperors had concentrated
the scanty remains of their power upon Germany
and North Italy, the highest feudal superiors in all the outlying
portions of the former Carlovingian empire found themselves
practically without a supreme head. Gradually they
habituated themselves to the new situation, and the fact of
immunity put at last out of sight the theory of dependence;
but there are many symptoms that this change was not quite
easily accomplished; and, indeed, to the impression that in
the nature of things there must necessarily be a culminating
domination somewhere, we may, no doubt, refer the increasing
tendency to attribute secular superiority to the
See of Rome. The completion of the first stage in the revolution
of opinion is marked, of course, by the accession of the
Capetian dynasty in France. When the feudal prince of a
limited territory surrounding Paris began, from the accident
of his uniting an unusual number of suzerainties in his own
person, to call himself <i>King of France</i>, he became king in quite
a new sense, a sovereign standing in the same relation to the
soil of France as the baron to his estate, the tenant to his
freehold. The precedent, however, was as influential as it
was novel, and the form of the monarchy in France had
visible effects in hastening changes which were elsewhere
proceeding in the same direction. The kingship of our Anglo-Saxon
regal houses was midway between the chieftainship of
a tribe and a territorial supremacy; but the superiority of
the Norman monarchs, imitated from that of the King of
France, was distinctly a territorial sovereignty. Every subsequent
dominion which was established or consolidated was
formed on the later model. Spain, Naples, and the principalities
founded on the ruins of municipal freedom in Italy,
were all under rulers whose sovereignty was territorial. Few
things, I may add, are more curious than the gradual lapse
of the <i>Venetians</i> from one view to the other. At the commencement
of its foreign conquests, the republic regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">064</a></span>
itself as an antitype of the Roman commonwealth, governing
a number of subject provinces. Move a century onwards,
and you find that it wishes to be looked upon as a corporate
sovereign, claiming the rights of a feudal suzerain over its
possessions in Italy and the &AElig;gean.</p>

<p>During the period through which the popular ideas on
the subject of sovereignty were undergoing this remarkable
change, the system which stood in the place of what we now
call International Law, was heterogeneous in form and inconsistent
in the principles to which it appealed. Over so much
of Europe as was comprised in the Romano-German empire,
the connection of the confederate states was regulated by
the complex and as yet incomplete mechanism of the Imperial
constitution; and, surprising as it may seem to us, it was a
favourite notion of German lawyers that the relations of
commonwealths, whether inside or outside the empire, ought
to be regulated not by the <i>Jus Gentium</i>, but by the pure
Roman jurisprudence, of which C&aelig;sar was still the centre.
This doctrine was less confidently repudiated in the outlying
countries than we might have supposed antecedently; but,
substantially, through the rest of Europe feudal subordinations
furnished a substitute for a public law; and when those
were undetermined or ambiguous, there lay behind, in theory
at least, a supreme regulating force in the authority of the
head of the Church. It is certain, however, that both feudal
and ecclesiastical influences were rapidly decaying during the
fifteenth, and even the fourteenth century; and if we closely
examine the current pretexts of wars, and the avowed
motives of alliances, it will be seen that, step by step with the
displacement of the old principles, the views afterwards
harmonised and consolidated by Ayala and Grotius were
making considerable progress, though it was silent and but
slow. Whether the fusion of all the sources of authority would
ultimately have evolved a system of international relations,
and whether that system would have exhibited material
differences from the fabric of Grotius, is not now possible to
decide, for as a matter of fact the Reformation annihilated all
its potential elements except one. Beginning in Germany,
it divided the princes of the empire by a gulf too broad
to be bridged over by the Imperial supremacy, even if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">065</a></span>the Imperial superior had stood neutral. He, however, was
forced to take colour with the church against the reformers;
the Pope was, as a matter of course, in the same predicament;
and thus the two authorities to whom belonged the office of
mediation between combatants became themselves the chiefs
of one great faction in the schism of the nations. Feudalism,
already enfeebled and discredited as a principle of public
relations, furnished no bond whatever which was stable
enough to countervail the alliances of religion. In a condition,
therefore, of public law which was little less than chaotic,
those views of a state system to which the Roman jurisconsults
were supposed to have given their sanction alone
remained standing. The shape, the symmetry, and the
prominence which they assumed in the hands of Grotius are
known to every educated man; but the great marvel of the
Treatise "De Jure Belli et Pacis," was its rapid, complete,
and universal success. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War,
the boundless terror and pity which the unbridled license of
the soldiery was exciting, must, no doubt, be taken to explain
that success in some measure, but they do not wholly account
for it. Very little penetration into the ideas of that age is
required to convince one that if the ground plan of the international
edifice which was sketched in the great book of
Grotius had not appeared to be theoretically perfect, it would
have been discarded by jurists and neglected by statesmen
and soldiers.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the speculative perfection of the Grotian
system is intimately connected with that conception of territorial
sovereignty which we have been discussing. The theory
of International Law assumes that commonwealths are,
relatively to each other, in a state of nature; but the component
atoms of a natural society must, by the fundamental
assumption, be insulated and independent of each other. If
there be a higher power connecting them, however slightly
and occasionally by the claim of common supremacy, the
very conception of a common superior introduces the notion
of positive law, and excludes the idea of a law natural. It
follows, therefore, that if the universal suzerainty of an
Imperial head had been admitted even in bare theory, the
labours of Grotius would have been idle. Nor is this the only
point of junction between modern public law and those views
of sovereignty of which I have endeavoured to describe the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">066</a></span>
development. I have said that there are entire departments of
international jurisprudence which consist of the Roman Law
of Property. What then is the inference? It is, that if there
had been no such change as I have described in the estimate
of sovereignty&mdash;if sovereignty had not been associated with
the proprietorship of a limited portion of the earth, had not,
in other words, become territorial&mdash;three parts of the Grotian
theory would have been incapable of application.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">067</a></span></p>

<p>The necessity of submitting the subject of jurisprudence to
scientific treatment has never been entirely lost sight of in
modern times, and the essays which the consciousness of this
necessity has produced have proceeded from minds of very
various calibre, but there is not much presumption, I think,
in asserting that what has hitherto stood in the place of a
science has for the most part been a set of guesses, those very
guesses of the Roman lawyers which were examined in the
two preceding chapters. A series of explicit statements,
recognising and adopting these conjectural theories of a
natural state, and of a system of principles congenial to it, has
been continued with but brief interruption from the days of
their inventors to our own. They appear in the annotations
of the Glossators who founded modern jurisprudence, and in
the writings of the scholastic jurists who succeeded them.
They are visible in the dogmas of the canonists. They are
thrust into prominence by those civilians of marvellous
erudition, who flourished at the revival of ancient letters.
Grotius and his successors invested them not less with
brilliancy and plausibility than with practical importance.
They may be read in the introductory chapters of our own
Blackstone, who has transcribed them textually from Burlamaqui,
and wherever the manuals published in the present
day for the guidance of the student or the practitioner begin
with any discussion of the first principles of law, it always
resolves itself into a restatement of the Roman hypothesis.
It is however from the disguises with which these conjectures
sometimes clothe themselves, quite as much as from their
native form, that we gain an adequate idea of the subtlety
with which they mix themselves in human thought. The
Lockeian theory of the origin of Law in a Social Compact
scarcely conceals its Roman derivation, and indeed is only the
dress by which the ancient views were rendered more attractive
to a particular generation of the moderns; but on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">068</a></span>
other hand the theory of Hobbes on the same subject was
purposely devised to repudiate the reality of a law of nature
as conceived by the Romans and their disciples. Yet these
two theories, which long divided the reflecting politicians of
England into hostile camps, resemble each other strictly in
their fundamental assumption of a non-historic, unverifiable,
condition of the race. Their authors differed as to the characteristics
of the pr&aelig;-social state, and as to the nature of
the abnormal action by which men lifted themselves out
of it into that social organisation with which alone we are
acquainted, but they agreed in thinking that a great chasm
separated man in his primitive condition from man in society,
and this notion we cannot doubt that they borrowed, consciously
or unconsciously, from the Romans. If indeed the
phenomena of law be regarded in the way in which these
theorists regarded them&mdash;that is, as one vast complex whole&mdash;it
is not surprising that the mind should often evade the
task it has set to itself by falling back on some ingenious conjecture
which (plausibly interpreted) will seem to reconcile
everything, or else that it should sometimes abjure in despair
the labour of systematization.</p>

<p>From the theories of jurisprudence which have the same
speculative basis as the Roman doctrine two of much celebrity
must be excepted. The first of them is that associated with the
great name of Montesquieu. Though there are some ambiguous
expressions in the early part of the <i>Esprit des Lois</i>,
which seem to show its writer's unwillingness to break quite
openly with the views hitherto popular, the general drift
of the book is certainly to indicate a very different conception
of its subject from any which had been entertained before.
It has often been noticed that, amidst the vast variety of
examples which, in its immense width of survey, it sweeps
together from supposed systems of jurisprudence, there is
an evident anxiety to thrust into especial prominence those
manners and institutions which astonish the civilised reader
by their uncouthness, strangeness, or indecency. The inference
constantly suggested is, that laws are the creatures of climate,
local situation, accident, or imposture&mdash;the fruit of any
causes except those which appear to operate with tolerable
constancy. Montesquieu seems, in fact, to have looked on
the nature of man as entirely plastic, as passively reproducing
the impressions, and submitting implicitly to the impulses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">069</a></span>
which it receives from without. And here no doubt lies the
error which vitiates his system as a system. He greatly
underrates the stability of human nature. He pays little
or no regard to the inherited qualities of the race, those
qualities which each generation receives from its predecessors,
and transmits but slightly altered to the generation which
follows it. It is quite true, indeed, that no complete account
can be given of social phenomena, and consequently of laws,
till due allowance has been made for those modifying causes
which are noticed in the <i>Esprit des Lois</i>; but their number
and their force appear to have been overestimated by Montesquieu.
Many of the anomalies which he parades have
since been shown to rest on false report or erroneous construction,
and of those which remain not a few prove the
permanence rather than the variableness of man's nature,
since they are relics of older stages of the race which have
obstinately defied the influences that have elsewhere had
effect. The truth is that the stable part of our mental, moral,
and physical constitution is the largest part of it, and the
resistance it opposes to change is such that, though the
variations of human society in a portion of the world are
plain enough, they are neither so rapid nor so extensive
that their amount, character, and general direction cannot
be ascertained. An approximation to truth may be all that
is attainable with our present knowledge, but there is no
reason for thinking that is so remote, or (what is the same
thing) that it requires so much future correction, as to be
entirely useless and uninstructive.</p>

<p>The other theory which has been adverted to is the historical
theory of Bentham. This theory which is obscurely
(and, it might even be said, timidly) propounded in several
parts of Bentham's works is quite distinct from that analysis
of the conception of law which he commenced in the "Fragment
on Government," and which was more recently completed
by Mr. John Austin. The resolution of a law into a
command of a particular nature, imposed under special conditions,
does not affect to do more than protect us against
a difficulty&mdash;a most formidable one certainly&mdash;of language.
The whole question remains open as to the motives of societies
in imposing these commands on themselves, as to the connection
of these commands with each other, and the nature of
their dependence on those which preceded them, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">070</a></span>
they have superseded. Bentham suggests the answer that
societies modify, and have always modified, their laws according
to modifications of their views of general expediency. It
is difficult to say that this proposition is false, but it certainly
appears to be unfruitful. For that which seems expedient
to a society, or rather to the governing part of it, when it
alters a rule of law is surely the same thing as the object,
whatever it may be, which it has in view when it makes the
change. Expediency and the greatest good are nothing more
than different names for the impulse which prompts the modification;
and when we lay down expediency as the rule of
change in law or opinion, all we get by the proposition is the
substitution of an express term for a term which is necessarily
implied when we say that a change takes place.</p>

<p>There is such wide-spread dissatisfaction with existing
theories of jurisprudence, and so general a conviction that they
do not really solve the questions they pretend to dispose of,
as to justify the suspicion that some line of inquiry necessary
to a perfect result has been incompletely followed or altogether
omitted by their authors. And indeed there is one
remarkable omission with which all these speculations are
chargeable, except perhaps those of Montesquieu. They take
no account of what law has actually been at epochs remote
from the particular period at which they made their appearance.
Their originators carefully observed the institutions of
their own age and civilisation, and those of other ages and
civilisations with which they had some degree of intellectual
sympathy, but, when they turned their attention to archaic
states of society which exhibited much superficial difference
from their own, they uniformly ceased to observe and began
guessing. The mistake which they committed is therefore
analogous to the error of one who, in investigating the laws
of the material universe, should commence by contemplating
the existing physical world as a whole, instead of beginning
with the particles which are its simplest ingredients. One
does not certainly see why such a scientific solecism should
be more defensible in jurisprudence than in any other region
of thought. It would seem antecedently that we ought to
commence with the simplest social forms in a state as near
as possible to their rudimentary condition. In other words,
if we followed the course usual in such inquiries, we should
penetrate as far up as we could in the history of primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">071</a></span>
societies. The phenomena which early societies present us
with are not easy at first to understand, but the difficulty
of grappling with them bears no proportion to the perplexities
which beset us in considering the baffling entanglement of
modern social organisation. It is a difficulty arising from their
strangeness and uncouthness, not from their number and
complexity. One does not readily get over the surprise
which they occasion when looked at from a modern point
of view; but when that is surmounted they are few enough
and simple enough. But even if they gave more trouble
than they do, no pains would be wasted in ascertaining
the germs out of which has assuredly been unfolded every
form of moral restraint which controls our actions and
shapes our conduct at the present moment.</p>

<p>The rudiments of the social state, so far as they are known
to us at all, are known through testimony of three sorts&mdash;accounts
by contemporary observers of civilisations less
advanced than their own, the records which particular races
have preserved concerning their primitive history, and ancient
law. The first kind of evidence is the best we could have
expected. As societies do not advance concurrently, but at
different rates of progress, there have been epochs at which
men trained to habits of methodical observation have really
been in a position to watch and describe the infancy of mankind.
Tacitus made the most of such an opportunity; but
the <i>Germany</i>, unlike most celebrated classical books, has not
induced others to follow the excellent example set by its
author, and the amount of this sort of testimony which we
possess is exceedingly small. The lofty contempt which a
civilised people entertains for barbarous neighbours has caused
a remarkable negligence in observing them, and this carelessness
has been aggravated at times by fear, by religious prejudice,
and even by the use of these very terms&mdash;civilisation
and barbarism&mdash;which convey to most persons the impression
of a difference not merely in degree but in kind. Even the
<i>Germany</i> has been suspected by some critics of sacrificing
fidelity to poignancy of contrast and picturesqueness of narrative.
Other histories too, which have been handed down to us
among the archives of the people to whose infancy they relate,
have been thought distorted by the pride of race or by the
religious sentiment of a newer age. It is important then to
observe that these suspicions, whether groundless or rational,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">072</a></span>
do not attach to a great deal of archaic law. Much of the old
law which has descended to us was preserved merely because
it was old. Those who practised and obeyed it did not pretend
to understand it; and in some cases they even ridiculed and
despised it. They offered no account of it except that it had
come down to them from their ancestors. If we confine our
attention, then, to those fragments of ancient institutions
which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been tampered
with, we are able to gain a clear conception of certain great
characteristics of the society to which they originally belonged.
Advancing a step further, we can apply our knowledge
to systems of law which, like the Code of Menu, are
as a whole of suspicious authenticity; and, using the key we
have obtained, we are in a position to discriminate those
portions of them which are truly archaic from those which
have been affected by the prejudices, interests, or ignorance
of the compiler. It will at least be acknowledged that, if
the materials for this process are sufficient, and if the comparisons
be accurately executed, the methods followed are
as little objectionable as those which have led to such
surprising results in comparative philology.</p>

<p>The effect of the evidence derived from comparative jurisprudence
is to establish that view of the primeval condition
of the human race which is known as the Patriarchal Theory.
There is no doubt, of course, that this theory was originally
based on the Scriptural history of the Hebrew patriarchs in
Lower Asia; but, as has been explained already, its connection
with Scripture rather militated than otherwise against
its reception as a complete theory, since the majority of the
inquirers who till recently addressed themselves with most
earnestness to the colligation of social phenomena, were either
influenced by the strongest prejudice against Hebrew antiquities
or by the strongest desire to construct their system without
the assistance of religious records. Even now there is
perhaps a disposition to undervalue these accounts, or rather
to decline generalising from them, as forming part of the
traditions of a Semitic people. It is to be noted, however,
that the legal testimony comes nearly exclusively from the
institutions of societies belonging to the Indo-European stock,
the Romans, Hindoos, and Sclavonians supplying the greater
part of it; and indeed the difficulty at the present stage of
the inquiry, is to know where to stop, to say of what races<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">073</a></span>
of men it is <i>not</i> allowable to lay down that the society in
which they are united was originally organised on the
patriarchal model. The chief lineaments of such a society,
as collected from the early chapters in Genesis, I need not
attempt to depict with any minuteness, both because they
are familiar to most of us from our earliest childhood, and
because, from the interest once attaching to the controversy
which takes its name from the debate between Locke and
Filmer, they fill a whole chapter, though not a very profitable
one, in English literature. The points which lie on the
surface of the history are these:&mdash;The eldest male parent&mdash;the
eldest ascendant&mdash;is absolutely supreme in his household.
His dominion extends to life and death, and is as unqualified
over his children and their houses as over his slaves; indeed
the relations of sonship and serfdom appear to differ in little
beyond the higher capacity which the child in blood possesses
of becoming one day the head of a family himself. The flocks
and herds of the children are the flocks and herds of the father,
and the possessions of the parent, which he holds in a representative
rather than in a proprietary character, are equally
divided at his death among his descendants in the first
degree, the eldest son sometimes receiving a double share
under the name of birthright, but more generally endowed
with no hereditary advantage beyond an honorary precedence.
A less obvious inference from the Scriptural accounts is that
they seem to plant us on the traces of the breach which is first
effected in the empire of the parent. The families of Jacob
and Esau separate and form two nations; but the families
of Jacob's children hold together and become a people. This
looks like the immature germ of a state or commonwealth,
and of an order of rights superior to the claims of family
relation.</p>

<p>If I were attempting for the more special purposes of
the jurist to express compendiously the characteristics of the
situation in which mankind disclose themselves at the dawn
of their history, I should be satisfied to quote a few verses
from the <i>Odyssee</i> of Homer:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>"They have neither assemblies for consultation nor <i>themistes</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">074</a></span>
but every one exercises jurisdiction over his wives and his
children, and they pay no regard to one another." These
lines are applied to the Cyclops, and it may not perhaps be
an altogether fanciful idea when I suggest that the Cyclops
is Homer's type of an alien and less advanced civilisation;
for the almost physical loathing which a primitive community
feels for men of widely different manners from its
own usually expresses itself by describing them as monsters,
such as giants, or even (which is almost always the case in
Oriental mythology) as demons. However that may be, the
verses condense in themselves the sum of the hints which are
given us by legal antiquities. Men are first seen distributed
in perfectly insulated groups, held together by obedience to
the parent. Law is the parent's word, but it is not yet in the
condition of those <i>themistes</i> which were analysed in the first
chapter of this work. When we go forward to the state of
society in which these early legal conceptions show themselves
as formed, we find that they still partake of the mystery
and spontaneity which must have seemed to characterise a
despotic father's commands, but that at the same time,
inasmuch as they proceed from a sovereign, they presuppose
a union of family groups in some wider organisation. The
next question is, what is the nature of this union and the
degree of intimacy which it involves? It is just here that
archaic law renders us one of the greatest of its services and
fills up a gap which otherwise could only have been bridged
by conjecture. It is full, in all its provinces, of the clearest
indications that society in primitive times was not what it is
assumed to be at present, a collection of <i>individuals</i>. In fact,
and in the view of the men who composed it, it was <i>an aggregation
of families</i>. The contrast may be most forcibly expressed
by saying that the <i>unit</i> of an ancient society was the Family,
of a modern society the Individual. We must be prepared to
find in ancient law all the consequences of this difference. It
is so framed as to be adjusted to a system of small independent
corporations. It is therefore scanty, because it is supplemented
by the despotic commands of the heads of households.
It is ceremonious, because the transactions to which it pays
regard resemble international concerns much more than the
quick play of intercourse between individuals. Above all it
has a peculiarity of which the full importance cannot be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">075</a></span>shown at present. It takes a view of <i>life</i> wholly unlike any
which appears in developed jurisprudence. Corporations
<i>never die</i>, and accordingly primitive law considers the entities
with which it deals, <i>i.e.</i> the patriarchal or family groups, as
perpetual and inextinguishable. This view is closely allied
to the peculiar aspect under which, in very ancient times,
moral attributes present themselves. The moral elevation
and moral debasement of the individual appear to be confounded
with, or postponed to, the merits and offences of the
group to which the individual belongs. If the community
sins, its guilt is much more than the sum of the offences
committed by its members; the crime is a corporate act, and
extends in its consequences to many more persons than have
shared in its actual perpetration. If, on the other hand, the
individual is conspicuously guilty, it is his children, his
kinsfolk, his tribesmen, or his fellow-citizens, who suffer with
him, and sometimes for him. It thus happens that the ideas
of moral responsibility and retribution often seem to be more
clearly realised at very ancient than at more advanced
periods, for, as the family group is immortal, and its liability
to punishment indefinite, the primitive mind is not perplexed
by the questions which become troublesome as soon as
the individual is conceived as altogether separate from the
group. One step in the transition from the ancient and simple
view of the matter to the theological or metaphysical explanations
of later days is marked by the early Greek notion of an
inherited curse. The bequest received by his posterity from
the original criminal was not a liability to punishment, but
a liability to the commission of fresh offences which drew
with them a condign retribution; and thus the responsibility
of the family was reconciled with the newer phase of thought
which limited the consequences of crime to the person of the
actual delinquent.</p>

<p>It would be a very simple explanation of the origin of
society if we could base a general conclusion on the hint
furnished us by the scriptural example already adverted to,
and could suppose that communities began to exist wherever
a family held together instead of separating at the death
of its patriarchal chieftain. In most of the Greek states and
in Rome there long remained the vestiges of an ascending
series of groups out of which the State was at first constituted.
The Family, House, and Tribe of the Romans may be taken
as the type of them, and they are so described to us that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">076</a></span>
can scarcely help conceiving them as a system of concentric
circles which have gradually expanded from the same point.
The elementary group is the Family, connected by common
subjection to the highest male ascendant. The aggregation
of Families forms the Gens or House. The aggregation of
Houses makes the Tribe. The aggregation of Tribes constitutes
the Commonwealth. Are we at liberty to follow these
indications, and to lay down that the commonwealth is a
collection of persons united by common descent from the
progenitor of an original family? Of this we may at least be
certain, that all ancient societies regarded themselves as
having proceeded from one original stock, and even laboured
under an incapacity for comprehending any reason except
this for their holding together in political union. The history
of political ideas begins, in fact, with the assumption that
kinship in blood is the sole possible ground of community
in political functions; nor is there any of those subversions
of feeling, which we term emphatically revolutions, so
startling and so complete as the change which is accomplished
when some other principle&mdash;such as that, for instance, of
<i>local contiguity</i>&mdash;establishes itself for the first time as the
basis of common political action. It may be affirmed then of
early commonwealths that their citizens considered all the
groups in which they claimed membership to be founded on
common lineage. What was obviously true of the Family
was believed to be true first of the House, next of the Tribe,
lastly of the State. And yet we find that along with this belief,
or, if we may use the word, this theory, each community
preserved records or traditions which distinctly showed that
the fundamental assumption was false. Whether we look
to the Greek states, or to Rome, or to the Teutonic aristocracies
in Ditmarsh which furnished Niebuhr with so many
valuable illustrations, or to the Celtic clan associations, or
to that strange social organisation of the Sclavonic Russians
and Poles which has only lately attracted notice, everywhere
we discover traces of passages in their history when men of
alien descent were admitted to, and amalgamated with, the
original brotherhood. Adverting to Rome singly, we perceive
that the primary group, the Family, was being constantly
adulterated by the practice of adoption, while stories seem
to have been always current respecting the exotic extraction
of one of the original Tribes and concerning a large addition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">077</a></span>
to the houses made by one of the early kings. The composition
of the state, uniformly assumed to be natural, was nevertheless
known to be in great measure artificial. This conflict
between belief or theory and notorious fact is at first sight
extremely perplexing; but what it really illustrates is the
efficiency with which Legal Fictions do their work in the
infancy of society. The earliest and most extensively employed
of legal fictions was that which permitted family
relations to be created artificially, and there is none to which
I conceive mankind to be more deeply indebted. If it had
never existed, I do not see how any one of the primitive groups,
whatever were their nature, could have absorbed another,
or on what terms any two of them could have combined,
except those of absolute superiority on one side and absolute
subjection on the other. No doubt, when with our modern
ideas we contemplate the union of independent communities,
we can suggest a hundred modes of carrying it out, the
simplest of all being that the individuals comprised in the
coalescing groups shall vote or act together according to local
propinquity; but the idea that a number of persons should
exercise political rights in common simply because they
happened to live within the same topographical limits was
utterly strange and monstrous to primitive antiquity. The
expedient which in those times commanded favour was
that the incoming population should <i>feign themselves</i> to be
descended from the same stock as the people on whom they
were engrafted; and it is precisely the good faith of this
fiction, and the closeness with which it seemed to imitate
reality, that we cannot now hope to understand. One circumstance,
however, which it is important to recollect, is
that the men who formed the various political groups were
certainly in the habit of meeting together periodically, for
the purpose of acknowledging and consecrating their association
by common sacrifices. Strangers amalgamated with the
brotherhood were doubtless admitted to these sacrifices; and
when that was once done we can believe that it seemed
equally easy, or not more difficult, to conceive them as sharing
in the common lineage. The conclusion then which is suggested
by the evidence is, not that all early societies were
formed by descent from the same ancestor, but that all of
them which had any permanence and solidity either were so
descended or assumed that they were. An indefinite number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">078</a></span>
of causes may have shattered the primitive groups, but wherever
their ingredients recombined, it was on the model or
principle of an association of kindred. Whatever were the
fact, all thought, language, and law adjusted themselves
to the assumption. But though all this seems to me to
be established with reference to the communities with
whose records we are acquainted, the remainder of their
history sustains the position before laid down as to the
essentially transient and terminable influence of the most
powerful Legal Fictions. At some point of time&mdash;probably
as soon as they felt themselves strong enough to resist extrinsic
pressure&mdash;all these states ceased to recruit themselves
by factitious extensions of consanguinity. They necessarily,
therefore, became Aristocracies, in all cases where a fresh
population from any cause collected around them which
could put in no claim to community of origin. Their sternness
in maintaining the central principle of a system under which
political rights were attainable on no terms whatever except
connection in blood, real or artificial, taught their inferiors
another principle, which proved to be endowed with a far
higher measure of vitality. This was the principle of <i>local
contiguity</i>, now recognised everywhere as the condition of
community in political functions. A new set of political ideas
came at once into existence, which, being those of ourselves,
our contemporaries, and in great measure of our ancestors,
rather obscure our perception of the older theory which they
vanquished and dethroned.</p>

<p>The Family then is the type of an archaic society in all the
modifications which it was capable of assuming; but the
family here spoken of is not exactly the family as understood
by a modern. In order to reach the ancient conception we
must give to our modern ideas an important extension and
an important limitation. We must look on the family as
constantly enlarged by the absorption of strangers within
its circle, and we must try to regard the fiction of adoption
as so closely simulating the reality of kinship that neither
law nor opinion makes the slightest difference between a real
and an adoptive connection. On the other hand, the persons
theoretically amalgamated into a family by their common
descent are practically held together by common obedience
to their highest living ascendant, the father, grandfather, or
great-grandfather. The patriarchal authority of a chieftain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">079</a></span>
is as necessary an ingredient in the notion of the family group
as the fact (or assumed fact) of its having sprung from his
loins; and hence we must understand that if there be any
persons who, however truly included in the brotherhood by
virtue of their blood-relationship, have nevertheless <i>de facto</i>
withdrawn themselves from the empire of its ruler, they are
always, in the beginnings of law, considered as lost to the
family. It is this patriarchal aggregate&mdash;the modern family
thus cut down on one side and extended on the other&mdash;which
meets us on the threshold of primitive jurisprudence.
Older probably than the State, the Tribe, and the House,
it left traces of itself on private law long after the House and
the Tribe had been forgotten, and long after consanguinity
had ceased to be associated with the composition of States.
It will be found to have stamped itself on all the great departments
of jurisprudence, and may be detected, I think, as the
true source of many of their most important and most
durable characteristics. At the outset, the peculiarities of law
in its most ancient state lead us irresistibly to the conclusion
that it took precisely the same view of the family group which
is taken of individual men by the systems of rights and
duties now prevalent throughout Europe. There are societies
open to our observation at this very moment whose laws and
usages can scarcely be explained unless they are supposed
never to have emerged from this primitive condition; but in
communities more fortunately circumstanced the fabric of
jurisprudence fell gradually to pieces, and if we carefully
observe the disintegration we shall perceive that it took place
principally in those portions of each system which were most
deeply affected by the primitive conception of the family.
In one all-important instance, that of the Roman law, the
change was effected so slowly, that from epoch to epoch we
can observe the line and direction which it followed, and can
even give some idea of the ultimate result to which it was
tending. And, in pursuing this last inquiry, we need not
suffer ourselves to be stopped by the imaginary barrier which
separates the modern from the ancient world. For one effect
of that mixture of refined Roman law with primitive barbaric
usage, which is known to us by the deceptive name of feudalism,
was to revive many features of archaic jurisprudence
which had died out of the Roman world, so that the decomposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">080</a></span>
hich had seemed to be over commenced again, and
to some extent is still proceeding.</p>

<p>On a few systems of law the family organisation of the
earliest society has left a plain and broad mark in the life-long
authority of the Father or other ancestor over the
person and property of his descendants, an authority which
we may conveniently call by its later Roman name of Patria
Potestas. No feature of the rudimentary associations of
mankind is deposed to by a greater amount of evidence than
this, and yet none seems to have disappeared so generally
and so rapidly from the usages of advancing communities.
Gaius, writing under the Antonines, describes the institution
as distinctively Roman. It is true that, had he glanced across
the Rhine or the Danube to those tribes of barbarians which
were exciting the curiosity of some among his contemporaries,
he would have seen examples of patriarchal power in its
crudest form; and in the far East a branch of the same
ethnical stock from which the Romans sprang was repeating
their Patria Potestas in some of its most technical incidents.
But among the races understood to be comprised within
the Roman empire, Gaius could find none which exhibited
an institution resembling the Roman "Power of the Father,"
except only the Asiatic Galat&aelig;. There are reasons, indeed, as
it seems to me, why the direct authority of the ancestor
should, in the greater number of progressive societies, very
shortly assume humbler proportions than belonged to it in
their earliest state. The implicit obedience of rude men to
their parent is doubtless a primary fact, which it would be
absurd to explain away altogether by attributing to them
any calculation of its advantages; but, at the same time, if
it is natural in the sons to obey the father, it is equally natural
that they should look to him for superior strength or superior
wisdom. Hence, when societies are placed under circumstances
which cause an especial value to be attached to bodily
and mental vigour, there is an influence at work which tends
to confine the Patria Potestas to the cases where its possessor
is actually skilful and strong. When we obtain our first glimpse
of organised Hellenic society, it seems as if supereminent
wisdom would keep alive the father's power in persons whose
bodily strength had decayed; but the relations of Ulysses and
Laertes in the <i>Odyssee</i> appear to show that, where extraordinary
valour and sagacity were united in the son, the father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">081</a></span>
in the decrepitude of age was deposed from the headship of the
family. In the mature Greek jurisprudence, the rule advances
a few steps on the practice hinted at in the Homeric literature;
and though very many traces of stringent family obligation
remain, the direct authority of the parent is limited, as in
European codes, to the nonage or minority of the children,
or, in other words, to the period during which their mental
and physical inferiority may always be presumed. The Roman
law, however, with its remarkable tendency to innovate on
ancient usage only just so far as the exigency of the commonwealth
may require, preserves both the primeval institution
and the natural limitation to which I conceive it to have been
subject. In every relation of life in which the collective
community might have occasion to avail itself of his wisdom
and strength, for all purposes of counsel or of war, the filius
familias, or Son under Power, was as free as his father. It
was a maxim of Roman jurisprudence that the Patria Potestas
did not extend to the Jus Publicum. Father and son voted
together in the city, and fought side by side in the field; indeed,
the son, as general, might happen to command the
father, or, as magistrate, decide on his contracts and punish
his delinquencies. But in all the relations created by Private
Law, the son lived under a domestic despotism which, considering
the severity it retained to the last, and the number
of centuries through which it endured, constitutes one of the
strangest problems in legal history.</p>

<p>The Patria Potestas of the Romans, which is necessarily
our type of the primeval paternal authority, is equally difficult
to understand as an institution of civilised life, whether
we consider its incidence on the person or its effects on property.
It is to be regretted that a chasm which exists in its
history cannot be more completely filled. So far as regards
the person, the parent, when our information commences, has
over his children the <i>jus vit&aelig; necisque</i>, the power of life and
death, and <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> of uncontrolled corporal chastisement;
he can modify their personal condition at pleasure; he can
give a wife to his son; he can give his daughter in marriage;
he can divorce his children of either sex; he can transfer
them to another family by adoption; and he can sell them.
Late in the Imperial period we find vestiges of all these powers,
but they are reduced within very narrow limits. The unqualified
right of domestic chastisement has become a right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">082</a></span>
of bringing domestic offences under the cognisance of the
civil magistrate; the privilege of dictating marriage has
declined into a conditional veto; the liberty of selling has
been virtually abolished, and adoption itself, destined to lose
almost all its ancient importance in the reformed system of
Justinian, can no longer be effected without the assent of the
child transferred to the adoptive parentage. In short, we are
brought very close to the verge of the ideas which have at
length prevailed in the modern world. But between these
widely distant epochs there is an interval of obscurity, and
we can only guess at the causes which permitted the Patria
Potestas to last as long as it did by rendering it more tolerable
than it appears. The active discharge of the most important
among the duties which the son owed to the state must have
tempered the authority of his parent if they did not annul it.
We can readily persuade ourselves that the paternal despotism
could not be brought into play without great scandal
against a man of full age occupying a high civil office. During
the earlier history, however, such cases of practical emancipation
would be rare compared with those which must have
been created by the constant wars of the Roman republic.
The military tribune and the private soldier who were in the
field three-quarters of a year during the earlier contests, at
a later period the proconsul in charge of a province, and the
legionaries who occupied it, cannot have had practical reason
to regard themselves as the slaves of a despotic master; and
all these avenues of escape tended constantly to multiply
themselves. Victories led to conquests, conquests to occupations;
the mode of occupation by colonies was exchanged
for the system of occupying provinces by standing armies.
Each step in advance was a call for the expatriation of more
Roman citizens and a fresh draft on the blood of the failing
Latin race. We may infer, I think, that a strong sentiment
in favour of the relaxation of the Patria Potestas had become
fixed by the time that the pacification of the world commenced
on the establishment of the Empire. The first serious
blows at the ancient institution are attributed to the earlier
C&aelig;sars, and some isolated interferences of Trajan and Hadrian
seem to have prepared the ground for a series of express
enactments which, though we cannot always determine their
dates, we know to have limited the father's powers on the
one hand, and on the other to have multiplied facilities for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">083</a></span>
their voluntary surrender. The older mode of getting rid of
the Potestas, by effecting a triple sale of the son's person,
is evidence, I may remark, of a very early feeling against the
unnecessary prolongation of the powers. The rule which
declared that the son should be free after having been three
times sold by his father seems to have been originally meant
to entail penal consequences on a practice which revolted
even the imperfect morality of the primitive Roman. But
even before the publication of the Twelve Tables it had been
turned, by the ingenuity of the jurisconsults, into an expedient
for destroying the parental authority wherever the
father desired that it should cease.</p>

<p>Many of the causes which helped to mitigate the stringency
of the father's power over the persons of his children are
doubtless among those which do not lie upon the face of
history. We cannot tell how far public opinion may have
paralysed an authority which the law conferred, or how far
natural affection may have rendered it endurable. But though
the powers over the <i>person</i> may have been latterly nominal,
the whole tenour of the extant Roman jurisprudence suggests
that the father's rights over the son's <i>property</i> were always
exercised without scruple to the full extent to which they
were sanctioned by law. There is nothing to astonish us in the
latitude of these rights when they first show themselves.
The ancient law of Rome forbade the Children under Power
to hold property apart from their parent, or (we should
rather say) never contemplated the possibility of their
claiming a separate ownership. The father was entitled to
take the whole of the son's acquisitions, and to enjoy the
benefit of his contracts without being entangled in any
compensating liability. So much as this we should expect
from the constitution of the earliest Roman society, for we
can hardly form a notion of the primitive family group unless
we suppose that its members brought their earnings of all
kinds into the common stock while they were unable to bind
it by improvident individual engagements. The true enigma
of the Patria Potestas does not reside here, but in the slowness
with which these proprietary privileges of the parent were
curtailed, and in the circumstance that, before they were
seriously diminished, the whole civilised world was brought
within their sphere. No innovation of any kind was attempted
till the first years of the Empire, when the acquisitions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">084</a></span>
soldiers on service were withdrawn from the operation of the
Patria Potestas, doubtless as part of the reward of the armies
which had overthrown the free commonwealth. Three centuries
afterwards the same immunity was extended to the
earnings of persons who were in the civil employment of the
state. Both changes were obviously limited in their application,
and they were so contrived in technical form as to
interfere as little as possible with the principle of Patria
Potestas. A certain qualified and dependent ownership had
always been recognised by the Roman law in the perquisites
and savings which slaves and sons under power were not
compelled to include in the household accounts, and the
special name of this permissive property, Peculium, was
applied to the acquisitions newly relieved from Patria Potestas,
which were called in the case of soldiers Castrense Peculium,
and Quasi-castrense Peculium in the case of civil
servants. Other modifications of the parental privileges followed,
which showed a less studious outward respect for the
ancient principle. Shortly after the introduction of the Quasi-castrense
Peculium, Constantine the Great took away the
father's absolute control over property which his children had
inherited from their mother, and reduced it to a <i>usufruct</i>, or
life-interest. A few more changes of slight importance followed
in the Western Empire, but the furthest point reached
was in the East, under Justinian, who enacted that unless
the acquisitions of the child were derived from the parent's
own property, the parent's rights over them should not extend
beyond enjoying their produce for the period of his life.
Even this, the utmost relaxation of the Roman Patria Potestas,
left it far ampler and severer than any analogous institution
of the modern world. The earliest modern writers on
jurisprudence remark that it was only the fiercer and ruder of
the conquerors of the empire, and notably the nations of
Sclavonic origin, which exhibited a Patria Potestas at all
resembling that which was described in the Pandects and the
Code. All the Germanic immigrants seem to have recognised
a corporate union of the family under the <i>mund</i>, or authority
of a patriarchal chief; but his powers are obviously only the
relics of a decayed Patria Potestas, and fell far short of those
enjoyed by the Roman father. The Franks are particularly
mentioned as not having the Roman Institution, and accordingly
the old French lawyers, even when most busily engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">085</a></span>
in filling the interstices of barbarous custom with rules of
Roman law, were obliged to protect themselves against the
intrusion of the Potestas by the express maxim, <i>Puyssance
de p&egrave;re en France n'a lieu</i>. The tenacity of the Romans in
maintaining this relic of their most ancient condition is in
itself remarkable, but it is less remarkable than the diffusion
of the Potestas over the whole of a civilisation from which
it had once disappeared. While the Castrense Peculium
constituted as yet the sole exception to the father's power
over property, and while his power over his children's persons
was still extensive, the Roman citizenship, and with it the
Patria Potestas, were spreading into every corner of the empire.
Every African or Spaniard, every Gaul, Briton, or Jew, who
received this honour by gift, purchase, or inheritance, placed
himself under the Roman Law of Persons, and, though our
authorities intimate that children born before the acquisition
of citizenship could not be brought under Power against their
will, children born after it and all ulterior descendants were
on the ordinary footing of a Roman <i>filius familias</i>. It does
not fall within the province of this treatise to examine the
mechanism of the later Roman society, but I may be permitted
to remark that there is little foundation for the
opinion which represents the constitution of Antoninus
Caracalla conferring Roman citizenship on the whole of his
subjects as a measure of small importance. However we
may interpret it, it must have enormously enlarged the
sphere of the Patria Potestas, and it seems to me that the
tightening of family relations which it effected is an agency
which ought to be kept in view more than it has been, in
accounting for the great moral revolution which was transforming
the world.</p>

<p>Before this branch of our subject is dismissed, it should be
observed that the Paterfamilias was answerable for the delicts
(or <i>torts</i>) of his Sons under Power. He was similarly liable
for the torts of his slaves; but in both cases he originally
possessed the singular privilege of tendering the delinquent's
person in full satisfaction of the damage. The responsibility
thus incurred on behalf of sons, coupled with the mutual
incapacity of parent and Child under Power to sue one another,
has seemed to some jurists to be best explained by the
assumption of a "unity of person" between the Paterfamilias
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">086</a></span>and the Filius-familias. In the chapter on Successions I shall attempt to show in what sense, and to what
extent, this "unity" can be accepted as a reality. I can
only say at present that these responsibilities of the Paterfamilias,
and other legal phenomena which will be discussed
hereafter, appear to me to point at certain <i>duties</i> of the
primitive Patriarchal chieftain which balanced his <i>rights</i>.
I conceive that, if he disposed absolutely of the persons and
fortune of his clansmen, this representative ownership was
coextensive with a liability to provide for all members of
the brotherhood out of the common fund. The difficulty is
to throw ourselves out of our habitual associations sufficiently
for conceiving the nature of his obligation. It was not a legal
duty, for law had not yet penetrated into the precinct of the
Family. To call it <i>moral</i> is perhaps to anticipate the ideas
belonging to a later stage of mental development; but the
expression "moral obligation" is significant enough for our
purpose, if we understand by it a duty semi-consciously
followed and enforced rather by instinct and habit than by
definite sanctions.</p>

<p>The Patria Potestas, in its normal shape, has not been, and,
as it seems to me, could not have been, a generally durable
institution. The proof of its former universality is therefore
incomplete so long as we consider it by itself; but the demonstration
may be carried much further by examining other
departments of ancient law which depend on it ultimately,
but not by a thread of connection visible in all its parts or
to all eyes. Let us turn for example to Kinship, or in other
words, to the scale on which the proximity of relatives to each
other is calculated in archaic jurisprudence. Here again it
will be convenient to employ the Roman terms, Agnatic and
Cognatic relationship. <i>Cognatic</i> relationship is simply the
conception of kinship familiar to modern ideas; it is the
relationship arising through common descent from the same
pair of married persons, whether the descent be traced
through males or females. <i>Agnatic</i> relationship is something
very different: it excludes a number of persons whom we in
our day should certainly consider of kin to ourselves, and
it includes many more whom we should never reckon among
our kindred. It is in truth the connection existing between
the members of the Family, conceived as it was in the most
ancient times. The limits of this connection are far from
conterminous with those of modern relationship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">087</a></span></p>

<p>Cognates then are all those persons who can trace their
blood to a single ancestor and ancestress; or, if we take the
strict technical meaning of the word in Roman law, they are
all who trace their blood to the legitimate marriage of a
common pair. "Cognation" is therefore a relative term,
and the degree of connection in blood which it indicates
depends on the particular marriage which is selected as the
commencement of the calculation. If we begin with the marriage
of father and mother, Cognation will only express the
relationship of brothers and sisters; if we take that of the
grandfather and grandmother, then uncles, aunts, and their
descendants will also be included in the notion of Cognation,
and following the same process a larger number of Cognates
may be continually obtained by choosing the starting point
higher and higher up in the line of ascent. All this is easily
understood by a modern; but who are the Agnates? In the
first place, they are all the Cognates who trace their connection
exclusively through males. A table of Cognates is, of course,
formed by taking each lineal ancestor in turn and including
all his descendants of both sexes in the tabular view; if then,
in tracing the various branches of such a genealogical table
or tree, we stop whenever we come to the name of a female
and pursue that particular branch or ramification no further,
all who remain after the descendants of women have been
excluded are Agnates, and their connection together is Agnatic
Relationship. I dwell a little on the process which is practically
followed in separating them from the Cognates, because
it explains a memorable legal maxim, "Mulier est finis
famili&aelig;"&mdash;a woman is the terminus of the family. A female
name closes the branch or twig of the genealogy in which it
occurs. None of the descendants of a female are included in
the primitive notion of family relationship.</p>

<p>If the system of archaic law at which we are looking be one
which admits Adoption, we must add to the Agnate thus
obtained all persons, male or female, who have been brought
into the Family by the artificial extension of its boundaries.
But the descendants of such persons will only be Agnates, if
they satisfy the conditions which have just been described.</p>

<p>What then is the reason of this arbitrary inclusion and
exclusion? Why should a conception of Kinship, so elastic
as to include strangers brought into the family by adoption,
be nevertheless so narrow as to shut out the descendants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">088</a></span>
of a female member? To solve these questions, we must
recur to the Patria Potestas. The foundation of Agnation
is not the marriage of Father and Mother, but the
authority of the Father. All persons are Agnatically connected
together who are under the same Paternal Power, or
who have been under it, or who might have been under it
if their lineal ancestor had lived long enough to exercise his
empire. In truth, in the primitive view, Relationship is
exactly limited by Patria Potestas. Where the Potestas
begins, Kinship begins; and therefore adoptive relatives are
among the kindred. Where the Potestas ends, Kinship ends;
so that a son emancipated by his father loses all rights of
Agnation. And here we have the reason why the descendants
of females are outside the limits of archaic kinship. If a
woman died unmarried, she could have no legitimate descendants.
If she married, her children fell under the Patria
Potestas, not of her Father, but of her Husband, and thus
were lost to her own family. It is obvious that the organisation
of primitive societies would have been confounded, if
men had called themselves relatives of their mother's relatives.
The inference would have been that a person might be subject
to two distinct Patri&aelig; Potestates; but distinct Patri&aelig;
Potestates implied distinct jurisdictions, so that anybody
amenable to two of them at the same time would have lived
under two different dispensations. As long as the Family was
an imperium in imperio, a community within the commonwealth,
governed by its own institutions of which the parent
was the source, the limitation of relationship to the Agnates
was a necessary security against a conflict of laws in the
domestic forum.</p>

<p>The Parental Powers proper are extinguished by the death
of the Parent, but Agnation is as it were a mould which retains
their imprint after they have ceased to exist. Hence comes
the interest of Agnation for the inquirer into the history of
jurisprudence. The Powers themselves are discernible in
comparatively few monuments of ancient law, but Agnatic
Relationship, which implies their former existence, is discoverable
almost everywhere. There are few indigenous
bodies of law belonging to communities of the Indo-European
stock, which do not exhibit peculiarities in the most ancient
part of their structure which are clearly referable to Agnation.
In Hindoo law, for example, which is saturated with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">089</a></span>
primitive notions of family dependency, kinship is entirely
Agnatic, and I am informed that in Hindoo genealogies the
names of women are generally omitted altogether. The same
view of relationship pervades so much of the laws of the races
who overran the Roman Empire as appears to have really
formed part of their primitive usage, and we may suspect
that it would have perpetuated itself even more than it has in
modern European jurisprudence, if it had not been for the
vast influence of the later Roman law on modern thought.
The Pr&aelig;tors early laid hold on Cognation as the <i>natural</i> form
of kinship, and spared no pains in purifying their system
from the older conception. Their ideas have descended to us,
but still traces of Agnation are to be seen in many of the
modern rules of succession after death. The exclusion of
females and their children from governmental functions,
commonly attributed to the usage of the Salian Franks, has
certainly an agnatic origin, being descended from the ancient
German rule of succession to allodial property. In Agnation
too is to be sought the explanation of that extraordinary rule
of English Law, only recently repealed, which prohibited
brothers of the half-blood from succeeding to one another's
lands. In the Customs of Normandy, the rule applies to
<i>uterine</i> brothers only, that is, to brothers by the same mother
but not by the same father; and, limited in this way, it is a
strict deduction from the system of Agnation, under which
uterine brothers are no relations at all to one another. When
it was transplanted to England, the English judges, who had
no clue to its principle, interpreted it as a general prohibition
against the succession of the half-blood, and extended it to
<i>consanguineous</i> brothers, that is to sons of the same father
by different wives. In all the literature which enshrines the
pretended philosophy of law, there is nothing more curious
than the pages of elaborate sophistry in which Blackstone
attempts to explain and justify the exclusion of the half-blood.</p>

<p>It may be shown, I think, that the Family, as held together
by the Patria Potestas, is the nidus out of which the entire
Law of Persons has germinated. Of all the chapters of that
Law the most important is that which is concerned with the
status of Females. It has just been stated that Primitive
Jurisprudence, though it does not allow a Woman to communicate
any rights of Agnation to her descendants, includes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">090</a></span>herself nevertheless in the Agnatic bond. Indeed, the relation
of a female to the family in which she was born is much
stricter, closer, and more durable than that which unites her
male kinsmen. We have several times laid down that early
law takes notice of Families only; this is the same thing as
saying that it only takes notice of persons exercising Patria
Potestas, and accordingly the only principle on which it enfranchises
a son or grandson at the death of his Parent, is a
consideration of the capacity inherent in such son or grandson
to become himself the head of a new family and the root of
a new set of Parental Powers. But a woman, of course, has no
capacity of the kind, and no title accordingly to the liberation
which it confers. There is therefore a peculiar contrivance
of archaic jurisprudence for retaining her in the bondage of
the Family for life. This is the institution known to the oldest
Roman law as the Perpetual Tutelage of Women, under which
a Female, though relieved from her Parent's authority by his
decease, continues subject through life to her nearest male
relations as her Guardians. Perpetual Guardianship is
obviously neither more nor less than an artificial prolongation
of the Patria Potestas, when for other purposes it has been
dissolved. In India, the system survives in absolute completeness,
and its operation is so strict that a Hindoo Mother
frequently becomes the ward of her own sons. Even in
Europe, the laws of the Scandinavian nations respecting
women preserved it until quite recently. The invaders of the
Western Empire had it universally among their indigenous
usages, and indeed their ideas on the subject of Guardianship,
in all its forms, were among the most retrogressive of those
which they introduced into the Western world. But from the
mature Roman jurisprudence it had entirely disappeared.
We should know almost nothing about it, if we had only the
compilations of Justinian to consult; but the discovery of the
manuscript of Gaius discloses it to us at a most interesting
epoch, just when it had fallen into complete discredit and
was verging on extinction. The great jurisconsult himself
scouts the popular apology offered for it in the mental inferiority
of the female sex, and a considerable part of his
volume is taken up with descriptions of the numerous
expedients, some of them displaying extraordinary ingenuity,
which the Roman lawyers had devised for enabling Women
to defeat the ancient rules. Led by their theory of Natural
Law, the jurisconsults had evidently at this time assumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">091</a></span>
the equality of the sexes as a principle of their code of equity.
The restrictions which they attacked were, it is to be observed,
restrictions on the disposition of property, for which the
assent of the woman's guardians was still formally required.
Control of her person was apparently quite obsolete.</p>

<p>Ancient Law subordinates the woman to her blood-relations,
while a prime phenomenon of modern jurisprudence has been
her subordination to her husband. The history of the change
is remarkable. It begins far back in the annals of Rome.
Anciently, there were three modes in which marriage might
be contracted according to Roman usage, one involving a
religious solemnity, the other two the observance of certain
secular formalities. By the religious marriage or <i>Confarreation</i>;
by the higher form of civil marriage, which was
called <i>Coemption</i>; and by the lower form, which was termed
<i>Usus</i>, the Husband acquired a number of rights over the
person and property of his wife, which were on the whole in
excess of such as are conferred on him in any system of
modern jurisprudence. But in what capacity did he acquire
them? Not as <i>Husband</i>, but as <i>Father</i>. By the Confarreation,
Coemption, and Usus, the woman passed <i>in manum viri</i>, that
is, in law she became the <i>Daughter</i> of her husband. She was
included in his Patria Potestas. She incurred all the liabilities
springing out of it while it subsisted, and surviving it when it
had expired. All her property became absolutely his, and
she was retained in tutelage after his death to the guardian
whom he had appointed by will. These three ancient forms of
marriage fell, however, gradually into disuse, so that, at the
most splendid period of Roman greatness, they had almost
entirely given place to a fashion of wedlock&mdash;old apparently,
but not hitherto considered reputable&mdash;which was founded
on a modification of the lower form of civil marriage. Without
explaining the technical mechanism of the institution now
generally popular, I may describe it as amounting in law to
little more than a temporary deposit of the woman by her
family. The rights of the family remained unimpaired, and the
lady continued in the tutelage of guardians whom her parents
had appointed and whose privileges of control overrode, in
many material respects, the inferior authority of her husband.
The consequence was that the situation of the Roman female,
whether married or unmarried, became one of great personal
and proprietary independence, for the tendency of the later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">092</a></span>
law, as I have already hinted, was to reduce the power of the
guardian to a nullity, while the form of marriage in fashion
conferred on the husband no compensating superiority. But
Christianity tended somewhat from the very first to narrow
this remarkable liberty. Led at first by justifiable disrelish
for the loose practices of the decaying heathen world, but
afterwards hurried on by a passion of asceticism, the professors
of the new faith looked with disfavour on a marital
tie which was in fact the laxest the Western world has seen.
The latest Roman law, so far as it is touched by the constitutions
of the Christian Emperors, bears some marks of a reaction
against the liberal doctrines of the great Antonine jurisconsults.
And the prevalent state of religious sentiment may
explain why it is that modern jurisprudence, forged in the
furnace of barbarian conquest, and formed by the fusion of
Roman jurisprudence with patriarchal usage, has absorbed,
among its rudiments, much more than usual of those rules
concerning the position of women which belong peculiarly
to an imperfect civilisation. During the troubled era which
begins modern history, and while the laws of the Germanic
and Sclavonic immigrants remained superposed like a
separate layer above the Roman jurisprudence of their provincial
subjects, the women of the dominant races are seen
everywhere under various forms of archaic guardianship, and
the husband who takes a wife from any family except his own
pays a money-price to her relations for the tutelage which
they surrender to him. When we move onwards, and the code
of the middle ages has been formed by the amalgamation of
the two systems, the law relating to women carries the stamp
of its double origin. The principle of the Roman jurisprudence
is so far triumphant that unmarried females are generally
(though there are local exceptions to the rule) relieved from
the bondage of the family; but the archaic principle of the
barbarians has fixed the position of married women, and the
husband has drawn to himself in his marital character the
powers which had once belonged to his wife's male kindred,
the only difference being that he no longer purchases his
privileges. At this point therefore the modern law of Western
and Southern Europe begins to be distinguished by one of its
chief characteristics, the comparative freedom it allows to
unmarried women and widows, the heavy disabilities it imposes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">093</a></span>on wives. It was very long before the subordination
entailed on the other sex by marriage was sensibly diminished.
The principal and most powerful solvent of the revived barbarism
of Europe was always the codified jurisprudence of
Justinian, wherever it was studied with that passionate
enthusiasm which it seldom failed to awaken. It covertly
but most efficaciously undermined the customs which it pretended
merely to interpret. But the Chapter of law relating
to married women was for the most part read by the light,
not of Roman, but of Canon Law, which in no one particular
departs so widely from the spirit of the secular jurisprudence
as in the view it takes of the relations created by marriage.
This was in part inevitable, since no society which preserves
any tincture of Christian institution is likely to restore to
married women the personal liberty conferred on them by the
middle Roman law, but the proprietary disabilities of married
females stand on quite a different basis from their personal
incapacities, and it is by keeping alive and consolidating the
former that the expositors of the Canon Law have deeply
injured civilisation. There are many vestiges of a struggle
between the secular and ecclesiastical principles, but the
Canon Law nearly everywhere prevailed. In some of the
French provinces married women, of a rank below nobility,
obtained all the powers of dealing with property which
Roman jurisprudence had allowed, and this local law has
been largely followed by the Code Napol&eacute;on; but the state
of the Scottish law shows that scrupulous deference to the
doctrines of the Roman jurisconsults did not always extend
to mitigating the disabilities of wives. The systems however
which are least indulgent to married women are invariably
those which have followed the Canon Law exclusively, or
those which, from the lateness of their contact with European
civilisation, have never had their archaisms weeded out. The
Scandinavian laws, harsh till lately to all females, are still
remarkable for their severity to wives. And scarcely less
stringent in the proprietary incapacities it imposes is the
English Common Law, which borrows far the greatest number
of its fundamental principles from the jurisprudence of the
Canonists. Indeed, the part of the Common Law which prescribes
the legal situation of married women may serve to
give an Englishman clear notions of the great institution
which has been the principal subject of this chapter. I do
not know how the operation and nature of the ancient Patria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">094</a></span>
Potestas can be brought so vividly before the mind as by reflecting
on the prerogatives attached to the husband by the
pure English Common Law, and by recalling the rigorous
consistency with which the view of a complete legal subjection
on the part of the wife is carried by it, where it is
untouched by equity or statutes, through every department
of rights, duties, and remedies. The distance between the
eldest and latest Roman law on the subject of Children under
Power may be considered as equivalent to the difference
between the Common Law and the jurisprudence of the Court
of Chancery in the rules which they respectively apply to
wives.</p>

<p>If we were to lose sight of the true origin of Guardianship
in both its forms and were to employ the common language
on these topics, we should find ourselves remarking that,
while the Tutelage of Women is an instance in which systems
of archaic law push to an extravagant length the fiction of
suspended rights, the rules which they lay down for the
Guardianship of Male Orphans are an example of a fault
in precisely the opposite direction. All such systems terminate
the Tutelage of males at an extraordinary early period.
Under the ancient Roman law, which may be taken as their
type, the son who was delivered from Patria Potestas by the
death of his Father or Grandfather remained under guardianship
till an epoch which for general purposes may be described
as arriving with his fifteenth year; but the arrival of that
epoch placed him at once in the full enjoyment of personal and
proprietary independence. The period of minority appears
therefore to have been as unreasonably short as the duration
of the disabilities of women was preposterously long. But,
in point of fact, there was no element either of excess or of
shortcoming in the circumstances which gave their original
form to the two kinds of guardianship. Neither the one nor
the other of them was based on the slightest consideration of
public or private convenience. The guardianship of male
orphans was no more designed originally to shield them till
the arrival of years of discretion than the tutelage of women
was intended to protect the other sex against its own feebleness.
The reason why the death of the father delivered the
son from the bondage of the family was the son's capacity for
becoming himself the head of a new family and the founder of
a new Patria Potestas; no such capacity was possessed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">095</a></span>
the woman and therefore she was <i>never</i> enfranchised. Accordingly
the Guardianship of Male Orphans was a contrivance
for keeping alive the semblance of subordination to the family
of the Parent, up to the time when the child was supposed
capable of becoming a parent himself. It was a prolongation
of the Patria Potestas up to the period of bare physical manhood.
It ended with puberty, for the rigour of the theory
demanded that it should do so. Inasmuch, however, as it did
not profess to conduct the orphan ward to the age of intellectual
maturity or fitness for affairs, it was quite unequal to
the purposes of general convenience; and this the Romans
seem to have discovered at a very early stage of their social
progress. One of the very oldest monuments of Roman
legislation is the <i>Lex L&aelig;toria</i> or <i>Pl&aelig;toria</i> which placed all free
males who were of full years and rights under the temporary
control of a new class of guardians, called <i>Curatores</i>, whose
sanction was required to validate their acts or contracts. The
twenty-sixth year of the young man's age was the limit of this
statutory supervision; and it is exclusively with reference
to the age of twenty-five that the terms "majority" and
"minority" are employed in Roman law. <i>Pupilage</i> or <i>wardship</i>
in modern jurisprudence had adjusted itself with tolerable
regularity to the simple principle of protection to the
immaturity of youth both bodily and mental. It has its
natural termination with years of discretion. But for protection
against physical weakness and for protection against
intellectual incapacity, the Romans looked to two different
institutions, distinct both in theory and design. The ideas
attendant on both are combined in the modern idea of
guardianship.</p>

<p>The Law of Persons contains but one other chapter which
can be usefully cited for our present purpose. The legal rules
by which systems of nature jurisprudence regulate the connection
of <i>Master and Slave</i>, present no very distinct traces
of the original condition common to ancient societies. But
there are reasons for this exception. There seems to be something
in the institution of Slavery which has at all times
either shocked or perplexed mankind, however little habituated
to reflection, and however slightly advanced in the
cultivation of its moral instincts. The compunction which
ancient communities almost unconsciously experienced appears
to have always resulted in the adoption of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">096</a></span>
imaginary principle upon which a defence, or at least a
rationale, of slavery could be plausibly founded. Very early
in their history the Greeks explained the institution as
grounded on the intellectual inferiority of certain races and
their consequent natural aptitude for the servile condition.
The Romans, in a spirit equally characteristic, derived it from
a supposed agreement between the victor and the vanquished
in which the first stipulated for the perpetual services of his
foe; and the other gained in consideration the life which he
had legitimately forfeited. Such theories were not only unsound
but plainly unequal to the case for which they affected
to account. Still they exercised powerful influence in many
ways. They satisfied the conscience of the Master. They
perpetuated and probably increased the debasement of the
Slave. And they naturally tended to put out of sight the
relation in which servitude had originally stood to the rest
of the domestic system. The relation, though not clearly
exhibited, is casually indicated in many parts of primitive
law, and more particularly in the typical system&mdash;that of
ancient Rome.</p>

<p>Much industry and some learning have been bestowed in
the United States of America on the question whether the
Slave was in the early stages of society a recognised member
of the Family. There is a sense in which an affirmative answer
must certainly be given. It is clear, from the testimony both
of ancient law and of many primeval histories, that the Slave
might under certain conditions be made the Heir, or Universal
Successor, of the Master, and this significant faculty, as I
shall explain in the Chapter on Succession, implies that the
government and representation of the Family might, in a
particular state of circumstances, devolve on the bondman.
It seems, however, to be assumed in the American arguments
on the subject that, if we allow Slavery to have been a primitive
Family institution, the acknowledgment is pregnant with
an admission of the moral defensibility of Negro-servitude
at the present moment. What then is meant by saying that
the Slave was originally included in the Family? Not that
his situation may not have been the fruit of the coarsest
motives which can actuate man. The simple wish to use the
bodily powers of another person as a means of ministering to
one's own ease or pleasure is doubtless the foundation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">097</a></span>Slavery, and as old as human nature. When we speak of the
Slave as anciently included in the Family, we intend to assert
nothing as to the motives of those who brought him into it
or kept him there; we merely imply that the tie which bound
him to his master was regarded as one of the same general
character with that which united every other member of the
group to its chieftain. This consequence is, in fact, carried
in the general assertion already made that the primitive
ideas of mankind were unequal to comprehending any basis
of the connection <i>inter se</i> of individuals, apart from the
relations of family. The Family consisted primarily of those
who belonged to it by consanguinity and next of those who
had been engrafted on it by adoption; but there was still a
third class of persons who were only joined to it by common
subjection to its head, and these were the Slaves. The born
and the adopted subjects of the chief were raised above the
Slave by the certainty that in the ordinary course of events
they would be relieved from bondage and entitled to exercise
powers of their own; but that the inferiority of the Slave
was not such as to place him outside the pale of the Family,
or such as to degrade him to the footing of inanimate property,
is clearly proved, I think, by the many traces which
remain of his ancient capacity for inheritance in the last
resort. It would, of course, be unsafe in the highest degree to
hazard conjectures how far the lot of the Slave was mitigated,
in the beginnings of society, by having a definite place
reserved to him in the empire of the Father. It is, perhaps,
more probable that the son was practically assimilated to the
Slave, than that the Slave shared any of the tenderness which
in later times was shown to the son. But it may be asserted
with some confidence of advanced and matured codes that,
wherever servitude is sanctioned, the Slave has uniformly
greater advantages under systems which preserve some
memento of his earlier condition than under those which have
adopted some other theory of his civil degradation. The point
of view from which jurisprudence regards the Slave is always
of great importance to him. The Roman law was arrested in
its growing tendency to look upon him more and more as an
article of property by the theory of the Law of Nature; and
hence it is that, wherever servitude is sanctioned by institutions
which have been deeply affected by Roman jurisprudence,
the servile condition is never intolerably wretched.
There is a great deal of evidence that in those American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">098</a></span>
States which have taken the highly Romanised code of
Louisiana as the basis of their jurisprudence, the lot and
prospects of the negro-population are better in many material
respects than under institutions founded on the English
Common Law, which, as recently interpreted, has no true
place for the Slave, and can only therefore regard him as a
chattel.</p>

<p>We have now examined all parts of the ancient Law of
Persons which fall within the scope of this treatise, and the
result of the inquiry is, I trust, to give additional definiteness
and precision to our view of the infancy of jurisprudence.
The Civil laws of States first make their appearance as the
Themistes of a patriarchal sovereign, and we can now see
that these Themistes are probably only a developed form of
the irresponsible commands which, in a still earlier condition
of the race, the head of each isolated household may have
addressed to his wives, his children, and his slaves. But, even
after the State has been organised, the laws have still an
extremely limited application. Whether they retain their
primitive character as Themistes, or whether they advance
to the condition of Customs or Codified Texts, they are binding
not on individuals, but on Families. Ancient jurisprudence,
if a perhaps deceptive comparison may be employed, may be
likened to International Law, filling nothing, as it were, excepting
the interstices between the great groups which are
the atoms of society. In a community so situated, the legislation
of assemblies and the jurisdiction of Courts reaches only
to the heads of families, and to every other individual the
rule of conduct is the law of his home, of which his Parent is
the legislator. But the sphere of civil law, small at first, tends
steadily to enlarge itself. The agents of legal change, Fictions,
Equity, and Legislation, are brought in turn to bear on the
primeval institutions, and at every point of the progress, a
greater number of personal rights and a larger amount of
property are removed from the domestic forum to the
cognisance of the public tribunals. The ordinances of the
government obtain gradually the same efficacy in private
concerns as in matters of state, and are no longer liable to be
overridden by the behests of a despot enthroned by each
hearthstone. We have in the annals of Roman law a nearly
complete history of the crumbling away of an archaic system,
and of the formation of new institutions from the recombined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">099</a></span>
materials, institutions some of which descended unimpaired
to the modern world, while others, destroyed or corrupted by
contact with barbarism in the dark ages, had again to be
recovered by mankind. When we leave this jurisprudence at
the epoch of its final reconstruction by Justinian, few traces
of archaism can be discovered in any part of it except in the
single article of the extensive powers still reserved to the
living Parent. Everywhere else principles of convenience, or
of symmetry, or of simplification&mdash;new principles at any rate&mdash;have
usurped the authority of the jejune considerations which
satisfied the conscience of ancient times. Everywhere a new
morality has displaced the canons of conduct and the reasons
of acquiescence which were in unison with the ancient usages,
because in fact they were born of them.</p>

<p>The movement of the progressive societies has been uniform
in one respect. Through all its course it has been distinguished
by the gradual dissolution of family dependency and
the growth of individual obligation in its place. The Individual
is steadily substituted for the Family, as the unit of
which civil laws take account. The advance has been accomplished
at varying rates of celerity, and there are societies
not absolutely stationary in which the collapse of the ancient
organisation can only be perceived by careful study of the
phenomena they present. But, whatever its pace, the change
has not been subject to reaction or recoil, and apparent
retardations will be found to have been occasioned through
the absorption of archaic ideas and customs from some entirely
foreign source. Nor is it difficult to see what is the tie between
man and man which replaces by degrees those forms of
reciprocity in rights and duties which have their origin in
the Family. It is Contract. Starting, as from one terminus
of history, from a condition of society in which all the relations
of Persons are summed up in the relations of Family, we seem
to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in
which all these relations arise from the free agreement of
Individuals. In Western Europe the progress achieved in this
direction has been considerable. Thus the status of the Slave
has disappeared&mdash;it has been superseded by the contractual
relation of the servant to his master. The status of the Female
under Tutelage, if the tutelage be understood of persons other
than her husband, has also ceased to exist; from her coming
of age to her marriage all the relations she may form are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
relations of contract. So too the status of the Son under
Power has no true place in law of modern European
societies. If any civil obligation binds together the Parent
and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives
its legal validity. The apparent exceptions are exceptions of
that stamp which illustrate the rule. The child before years
of discretion, the orphan under guardianship, the adjudged
lunatic, have all their capacities and incapacities regulated
by the Law of Persons. But why? The reason is differently
expressed in the conventional language of different systems,
but in substance it is stated to the same effect by all. The
great majority of Jurists are constant to the principle that
the classes of persons just mentioned are subject to extrinsic
control on the single ground that they do not possess the
faculty of forming a judgment on their own interests; in
other words, that they are wanting in the first essential of an
engagement by Contract.</p>

<p>The word Status may be usefully employed to construct a
formula expressing the law of progress thus indicated, which,
whatever be its value, seems to me to be sufficiently ascertained.
All the forms of Status taken notice of in the Law of
Persons were derived from, and to some extent are still
coloured by, the powers and privileges anciently residing in
the Family. If then we employ Status, agreeably with the
usage of the best writers, to signify these personal conditions
only, and avoid applying the term to such conditions as are
the immediate or remote result of agreement, we may say
that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto
been a movement <i>from Status to Contract</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the early history of testamentary succession</span></h4>


<p>If an attempt were made to demonstrate in England the
superiority of the historical method of investigation to the
modes of inquiry concerning Jurisprudence which are in
fashion among us, no department of Law would better serve
as an example than Testaments or Wills. Its capabilities it
owes to its great length and great continuity. At the beginning
of its history we find ourselves in the very infancy of
the social state, surrounded by conceptions which it requires
some effort of mind to realise in their ancient form; while
here, at the other extremity of its line of progress, we are in
the midst of legal notions which are nothing more than those
same conceptions disguised by the phraseology and by the
habits of thought which belong to modern times, and exhibiting
therefore a difficulty of another kind, the difficulty
of believing that ideas which form part of our everyday
mental stock can really stand in need of analysis and examination.
The growth of the Law of Wills between these extreme
points can be traced with remarkable distinctness. It was
much less interrupted at the epoch of the birth of feudalism,
than the history of most other branches of law. It is, indeed,
true that, as regards all provinces of jurisprudence, the break
caused by the division between ancient and modern history,
or in other words by the dissolution of the Roman empire,
has been very greatly exaggerated. Indolence has disinclined
many writers to be at the pains of looking for threads of
connection entangled and obscured by the confusions of
six troubled centuries, while other inquirers, not naturally
deficient in patience and industry, have been misled by idle
pride in the legal system of their country, and by consequent
unwillingness to confess its obligations to the jurisprudence of
Rome. But these unfavourable influences have had comparatively
little effect on the province of Testamentary Law.
The barbarians were confessedly strangers to any such conception
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>as that of a Will. The best authorities agree that
there is no trace of it in those parts of their written codes
which comprise the customs practised by them in their
original seats, and in their subsequent settlements on the
edge of the Roman empire. But soon after they became mixed
with the population of the Roman provinces they appropriated
from the Imperial jurisprudence the conception of
a Will, at first in part, and afterwards in all its integrity.
The influence of the Church had much to do with this rapid
assimilation. The ecclesiastical power had very early succeeded
to those privileges of custody and registration of
Testaments which several of the heathen temples had enjoyed;
and even thus early it was almost exclusively to private bequests
that the religious foundations owed their temporal
possessions. Hence it is that the decrees of the earliest
Provincial Councils perpetually contain anathemas against
those who deny the sanctity of Wills. Here, in England,
Church influence was certainly chief among the causes which
by universal acknowledgment have prevented that discontinuity
in the history of Testamentary Law, which is sometimes
believed to exist in the history of other provinces of
Jurisprudence. The jurisdiction over one class of Wills was
delegated to the Ecclesiastical Courts, which applied to them,
though not always intelligently, the principles of Roman
jurisprudence; and, though neither the courts of Common
Law nor the Court of Chancery owned any positive obligation
to follow the Ecclesiastical tribunals, they could not
escape the potent influence of a system of settled rules in
course of application by their side. The English law of testamentary
succession to personalty has become a modified form
of the dispensation under which the inheritances of Roman
citizens were administered.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to point out the extreme difference of
the conclusions forced on us by the historical treatment of
the subject from those to which we are conducted when, without
the help of history, we merely strive to analyse our <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> impressions. I suppose there is nobody who, starting
from the popular or even the legal conception of a Will, would
not imagine that certain qualities are necessarily attached to
it. He would say, for example, that a Will necessarily takes
effect <i>at death only</i>&mdash;that it is <i>secret</i>, not known as a matter
of course to persons taking interests under its provisions&mdash;that
it is <i>revocable</i>, <i>i.e.</i> always capable of being superseded by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
a new act of testation. Yet I shall be able to show that there
was a time when none of these characteristics belonged to a
Will. The Testaments from which our Wills are directly
descended at first took effect immediately on their execution;
they were not secret; they were not revocable. Few legal
agencies are, in fact, the fruit of more complex historical
agencies than that by which a man's written intentions control
the posthumous disposition of his goods. Testaments
very slowly and gradually gathered round them the qualities
I have mentioned; and they did this from causes and under
pressure of events which may be called casual, or which at any
rate have no interest for us at present, except so far as they
have affected the history of law.</p>

<p>At a time when legal theories were more abundant than at
present&mdash;theories which, it is true, were for the most part
gratuitous and premature enough, but which nevertheless
rescued jurisprudence from that worse and more ignoble condition,
not unknown to ourselves, in which nothing like a
generalisation is aspired to, and law is regarded as a mere
empirical pursuit&mdash;it was the fashion to explain the ready and
apparently intuitive perception which we have of certain
qualities in a Will, by saying that they were natural to it, or,
as the phrase would run in full, attached to it by the Law of
Nature. Nobody, I imagine, would affect to maintain such a
doctrine, when once it was ascertained that all these characteristics
had their origin within historical memory; at the
same time, vestiges of the theory of which the doctrine is an
offshoot, linger in forms of expression which we all of us use
and perhaps scarcely know how to dispense with. I may
illustrate this by mentioning a position common in the legal
literature of the seventeenth century. The jurists of that
period very commonly assert that the power of Testation itself
is of Natural Law, that it is a right conferred by the Law of
Nature. Their teaching, though all persons may not at once
see the connection, is in substance followed by those who
affirm that the right of dictating or controlling the posthumous
disposal of property is a necessary or natural consequence
of the proprietary rights themselves. And every student of
technical jurisprudence must have come across the same view,
clothed in the language of a rather different school, which,
in its rationale of this department of law, treats succession
<i>ex testamento</i> as the mode of devolution which the property of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
deceased persons ought primarily to follow, and then proceeds
to account for succession <i>ab intestato</i> as the incidental
provision of the lawgiver for the discharge of a function which
was only left unperformed through the neglect or misfortune
of the deceased proprietor. These opinions are only expanded
forms of the more compendious doctrine that Testamentary
disposition is an institution of the Law of Nature. It is certainly
never quite safe to pronounce dogmatically as to the
range of association embraced by modern minds, when they
reflect on Nature and her Law; but I believe that most
persons, who affirm that the Testamentary Power is of
Natural Law, may be taken to imply either that, as a matter
of fact, it is universal, or that nations are prompted to sanction
it by an original instinct and impulse. With respect to
the first of these positions, I think that, when explicitly set
forth, it can never be seriously contended for in an age which
has seen the severe restraints imposed on the Testamentary
Power by the <i>Code Napol&eacute;on</i>, and has witnessed the steady
multiplication of systems for which the French codes have
served as a model. To the second assertion we must object
that it is contrary to the best-ascertained facts in the early
history of law, and I venture to affirm generally that, in all
indigenous societies, a condition of jurisprudence in which
Testamentary privileges are <i>not</i> allowed, or rather not contemplated,
has preceded that later stage of legal development
in which the mere will of the proprietor is permitted under
more or less of restriction to override the claims of his kindred
in blood.</p>

<p>The conception of a Will or Testament cannot be considered
by itself. It is a member, and not the first, of a series
of conceptions. In itself a Will is simply the instrument by
which the intention of the testator is declared. It must be
clear, I think, that before such an instrument takes its turn
for discussion, there are several preliminary points to be
examined&mdash;as, for example, what is it, what sort of right or
interest, which passes from a dead man on his decease? to
whom and in what form does it pass? and how came it that
the dead were allowed to control the posthumous disposition
of their property? Thrown into technical language, the
dependence of the various conceptions which contribute to
the notion of a Will is thus expressed. A Will or Testament
is an instrument by which the devolution of an inheritance is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
prescribed. Inheritance is a form of universal succession. A
universal succession is a succession to a <i>universitas juris</i>, or
university of rights and duties. Inverting this order we have
therefore to inquire what is a <i>universitas juris</i>; what is a
universal succession; what is the form of universal succession
which is called an inheritance? And there are also two further
questions, independent to some extent of the points I have
mooted, but demanding solution before the subject of Wills
can be exhausted. These are, how came an inheritance to be
controlled in any case by the testator's volition, and what is
the nature of the instrument by which it came to be controlled?</p>

<p>The first question relates to the <i>universitas juris</i>; that is,
a university (or bundle) of rights and duties. A <i>universitas
juris</i> is a collection of rights and duties united by the single
circumstance of their having belonged at one time to some
one person. It is, as it were, the legal clothing of some given
individual. It is not formed by grouping together <i>any</i> rights
and <i>any</i> duties. It can only be constituted by taking all the
rights and all the duties of a particular person. The tie
which so connects a number of rights of property, rights of
way, rights to legacies, duties of specific performance, debts,
obligations to compensate wrongs&mdash;which so connects all these
legal privileges and duties together as to constitute them a
<i>universitas juris</i>, is the <i>fact</i> of their having attached to some
individual capable of exercising them. Without this <i>fact</i>
there is no university of rights and duties. The expression
<i>universitas juris</i> is not classical, but for the notion jurisprudence
is exclusively indebted to Roman law; nor is it at
all difficult to seize. We must endeavour to collect under one
conception the whole set of legal relations in which each one
of us stands to the rest of the world. These, whatever be their
character and composition, make up together a <i>universitas
juris</i>; and there is but little danger of mistake in forming
the notion, if we are only careful to remember that duties
enter into it quite as much as rights. Our duties may overbalance
our rights. A man may owe more than he is worth,
and therefore if a money value is set on his collective legal
relations he may be what is called insolvent. But for all that
the entire group of rights and duties which centres in him is
not the less a "juris universitas."</p>

<p>We come next to a "universal succession." A universal
succession is a succession to a <i>universitas juris</i>. It occurs when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
one man is invested with the legal clothing of another, becoming
at the same moment subject to all his liabilities and
entitled to all his rights. In order that the universal succession
may be true and perfect, the devolution must take place <i>uno
ictu</i>, as the jurists phrase it. It is of course possible to conceive
one man acquiring the whole of the rights and duties of
another at different periods, as for example by successive
purchases; or he might acquire them in different capacities,
part as heir, part as purchaser, part as legatee. But though
the group of rights and duties thus made up should in fact
amount to the whole legal personality of a particular individual,
the acquisition would not be a universal succession.
In order that there may be a true universal succession, the
transmission must be such as to pass the whole aggregate of
rights and duties at the <i>same</i> moment and in virtue of the <i>same</i>
legal capacity in the recipient. The notion of a universal succession,
like that of a juris universitas, is permanent in jurisprudence,
though in the English legal system it is obscured
by the great variety of capacities in which rights are acquired,
and, above all, by the distinction between the two great
provinces of English property, "realty" and "personalty."
The succession of an assignee in bankruptcy to the entire
property of the bankrupt is, however, a universal succession,
though as the assignee only pays debts to the extent of the
assets, this is only a modified form of the primary notion.
Were it common among us for persons to take assignments
of <i>all</i> a man's property on condition of paying <i>all</i> his debts,
such transfers would exactly resemble the universal successions
known to the oldest Roman Law. When a Roman
citizen <i>adrogated</i> a son, <i>i.e.</i> took a man, not already under
Patria Potestas, as his adoptive child, he succeeded <i>universally</i>
to the adoptive child's estate, <i>i.e.</i> he took all the property
and became liable for all the obligations. Several other forms
of universal succession appear in the primitive Roman Law,
but infinitely the most important and the most durable of all
was that one with which we are more immediately concerned,
H&aelig;reditas or Inheritance. Inheritance was a universal succession
occurring at a death. The universal successor was
H&aelig;res or Heir. He stepped at once into all the rights and all
the duties of the dead man. He was instantly clothed with
his entire legal person, and I need scarcely add that the
special character of the H&aelig;res remained the same, whether he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
was named by a Will or whether he took on an Intestacy.
The term H&aelig;res is no more emphatically used of the Intestate
than of the Testamentary Heir, for the manner in which a
man became H&aelig;res had nothing to do with the legal character
he sustained. The dead man's universal successor, however
he became so, whether by Will or by Intestacy, was his Heir.
But the Heir was not necessarily a single person. A group of
persons considered in law as a single unit, might succeed as
<i>co-heirs</i> to the Inheritance.</p>

<p>Let me now quote the usual Roman definition of an Inheritance.
The reader will be in a position to appreciate the full
force of the separate terms. <i>H&aelig;reditas est successio in universum
jus quod defunctus habuit</i> ("an inheritance is a succession
to the entire legal position of a deceased man"). The
notion was that, though the physical person of the deceased
had perished, his legal personality survived and descended
unimpaired on his Heir or Co-heirs, in whom his identity (so
far as the law was concerned) was continued. Our own law,
in constituting the Executor or Administrator the representative
of the deceased to the extent of his personal assets,
may serve as an illustration of the theory from which it
emanated, but, although it illustrates, it does not explain it.
The view of even the later Roman Law required a closeness of
correspondence between the position of the deceased and of
his Heir which is no feature of an English representation;
and in the primitive jurisprudence everything turned on the
continuity of succession. Unless provision was made in the
will for the instant devolution of the testator's rights and
duties on the Heir or Co-heirs, the testament lost all its effect.</p>

<p>In modern Testamentary jurisprudence, as in the later
Roman law, the object of first importance is the execution of
the testator's intentions. In the ancient law of Rome the
subject of corresponding carefulness was the bestowal of the
Universal Succession. One of these rules seems to our eyes a
principle dictated by common sense, while the other looks
very much like an idle crotchet. Yet that without the second
of them the first would never have come into being is as certain
as any proposition of the kind can be.</p>

<p>In order to solve this apparent paradox, and to bring into
greater clearness the train of ideas which I have been endeavouring
to indicate, I must borrow the results of the
inquiry which was attempted in the earlier portion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
preceding chapter. We saw one peculiarity invariably distinguishing
the infancy of society. Men are regarded and
treated, not as individuals, but always as members of a
particular group. Everybody is first a citizen, and then, as a
citizen, he is a member of his order&mdash;of an aristocracy or
a democracy, of an order of patricians or plebeians; or, in
those societies which an unhappy fate has afflicted with a
special perversion in their course of development, of a caste.
Next, he is a member of a gens, house, or clan; and lastly,
he is a member of his <i>family</i>. This last was the narrowest and
most personal relation in which he stood; nor, paradoxical
as it may seem, was he ever regarded as <i>himself</i>, as a distinct
individual. His individuality was swallowed up in his family.
I repeat the definition of a primitive society given before. It
has for its units, not individuals, but groups of men united
by the reality or the fiction of blood-relationship.</p>

<p>It is in the peculiarities of an undeveloped society that
we seize the first trace of a universal succession. Contrasted
with the organisation of a modern state, the commonwealths
of primitive times may be fairly described as consisting of a
number of little despotic governments, each perfectly distinct
from the rest, each absolutely controlled by the prerogative
of a single monarch. But though the Patriarch, for
we must not yet call him the Pater-familias, had rights thus
extensive, it is impossible to doubt that he lay under an equal
amplitude of obligations. If he governed the family, it was
for its behoof. If he was lord of its possessions, he held them
as trustee for his children and kindred. He had no privilege
or position distinct from that conferred on him by his relation
to the petty commonwealth which he governed. The Family,
in fact, was a Corporation; and he was its representative or,
we might almost say, its Public officer. He enjoyed rights
and stood under duties, but the rights and the duties were,
in the contemplation of his fellow-citizens and in the eye of
the law, quite as much those of the collective body as his own.
Let us consider for a moment the effect which would be produced
by the death of such a representative. In the eye of
the law, in the view of the civil magistrate, the demise of the
domestic authority would be a perfectly immaterial event.
The person representing the collective body of the family and
primarily responsible to municipal jurisdiction would bear
a different name; and that would be all. The rights and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
obligations which attached to the deceased head of the house
would attach, without breach of continuity, to his successor;
for, in point of fact, they would be the rights and obligations
of the family, and the family had the distinctive characteristic
of a corporation&mdash;that it never died. Creditors would
have the same remedies against the new chieftain as against
the old, for the liability being that of the still existing family
would be absolutely unchanged. All rights available to the
family would be as available after the demise of the headship
as before it&mdash;except that the Corporation would be
obliged&mdash;if indeed language so precise and technical can be
properly used of these early times&mdash;would be obliged to <i>sue</i>
under a slightly modified name.</p>

<p>The history of jurisprudence must be followed in its whole
course, if we are to understand how gradually and tardily
society dissolved itself into the component atoms of which
it is now constituted&mdash;by what insensible gradations the
relation of man to man substituted itself for the relation of
the individual to his family and of families to each other.
The point now to be attended to is that even when the
revolution had apparently quite accomplished itself, even
when the magistrate had in great measure assumed the place
of the Pater-familias, and the civil tribunal substituted itself
for the domestic forum, nevertheless the whole scheme of
rights and duties administered by the judicial authorities
remained shaped by the influence of the obsolete privileges
and coloured in every part by their reflection. There seems
little question that the devolution of the Universitas Juris,
so strenuously insisted upon by the Roman Law as the first
condition of a testamentary or intestate succession, was a
feature of the older form of society which men's minds had
been unable to dissociate from the new, though with that
newer phase it had no true or proper connection. It seems,
in truth, that the prolongation of a man's legal existence in
his heir, or in a group of co-heirs, is neither more nor less
than a characteristic of <i>the family</i> transferred by a fiction
to <i>the individual</i>. Succession in corporations is necessarily
universal, and the family was a corporation. Corporations
never die. The decease of individual members makes no
difference to the collective existence of the aggregate body,
and does not in any way affect its legal incidents, its faculties
or liabilities. Now in the idea of a Roman universal succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
all these qualities of a corporation seem to have been transferred
to the individual citizen. His physical death is allowed
to exercise no effect on the legal position which he filled,
apparently on the principle that that position is to be adjusted
as closely as possible to the analogies of a family, which, in
its corporate character, was not of course liable to physical
extinction.</p>

<p>I observe that not a few continental jurists have much
difficulty in comprehending the nature of the connection
between the conceptions blended in a universal succession,
and there is perhaps no topic in the philosophy of jurisprudence
on which their speculations, as a general rule, possess so
little value. But the student of English law ought to be in no
danger of stumbling at the analysis of the idea which we are
examining. Much light is cast upon it by a fiction in our own
system with which all lawyers are familiar. English lawyers
classify corporations as Corporations aggregate and Corporations
sole. A Corporation aggregate is a true Corporation, but
a Corporation sole is an individual, being a member of a series
of individuals, who is invested by a fiction with the qualities
of a Corporation. I need hardly cite the King or the Parson
of a Parish as instances of Corporations sole. The capacity
or office is here considered apart from the particular person
who from time to time may occupy it, and, this capacity being
perpetual, the series of individuals who fill it are clothed with
the leading attribute of Corporations&mdash;Perpetuity. Now in the
older theory of Roman Law the individual bore to the family
precisely the same relation which in the rationale of English
jurisprudence a Corporation sole bears to a Corporation
aggregate. The derivation and association of ideas are
exactly the same. In fact, if we say to ourselves that for purposes
of Roman Testamentary Jurisprudence each individual
citizen was a Corporation sole, we shall not only realise the
full conception of an inheritance, but have constantly at
command the clue to the assumption in which it originated.
It is an axiom with us that the King never dies, being a
Corporation sole. His capacities are instantly filled by his
successor, and the continuity of dominion is not deemed
to have been interrupted. With the Romans it seemed an
equally simple and natural process, to eliminate the fact of
death from the devolution of rights and obligations. The
testator lived on in his heir or in the group of his co-heirs. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
was in law the same person with them, and if any one in his
testamentary dispositions had even constructively violated
the principle which united his actual and his posthumous
existence, the law rejected the defective instrument, and
gave the inheritance to the kindred in blood, whose capacity
to fulfil the conditions of heirship was conferred on them
by the law itself, and not by any document which by possibility
might be erroneously framed.</p>

<p>When a Roman citizen died intestate or leaving no valid
Will, his descendants or kindred became his heirs according
to a scale which will be presently described. The person or
class of persons who succeeded did not simply <i>represent</i> the
deceased, but, in conformity with the theory just delineated,
they <i>continued</i> his civil life, his legal existence. The same
results followed when the order of succession was determined
by a Will, but the theory of the identity between the
dead man and his heirs was certainly much older than any
form of Testament or phase of Testamentary jurisprudence.
This indeed is the proper moment for suggesting a doubt
which will press on us with greater force the further we plumb
the depths of this subject,&mdash;whether <i>wills</i> would ever have
come into being at all if it had not been for these remarkable
ideas connected with universal succession. Testamentary
law is the application of a principle which may be explained
on a variety of philosophical hypotheses as plausible as they
are gratuitous; it is interwoven with every part of modern
society, and it is defensible on the broadest grounds of general
expediency. But the warning can never be too often repeated,
that the grand source of mistake in questions of jurisprudence
is the impression that those reasons which actuate us at the
present moment, in the maintenance of an existing institution,
have necessarily anything in common with the sentiment in
which the institution originated. It is certain that, in the old
Roman Law of Inheritance, the notion of a will or testament
is inextricably mixed up, I might almost say confounded,
with the theory of a man's posthumous existence in the
person of his heir.</p>

<p>The conception of a universal succession, firmly as it has
taken root in jurisprudence, has not occurred spontaneously
to the framers of every body of laws. Wherever it is now
found, it may be shown to have descended from Roman law;
and with it have come down a host of legal rules on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
subject of Testaments and Testamentary gifts, which modern
practitioners apply without discerning their relation to the
parent theory. But, in the pure Roman jurisprudence, the
principle that a man lives on in his Heir&mdash;the elimination, if
we may so speak, of the fact of death&mdash;is too obviously for
mistake the centre round which the whole Law of Testamentary
and Intestate succession is circling. The unflinching
sternness of the Roman law in enforcing compliance with
the governing theory would in itself suggest that the theory
grew out of something in the primitive constitution of Roman
society; but we may push the proof a good way beyond the
presumption. It happens that several technical expressions,
dating from the earliest institution of Wills at Rome, have
been accidentally preserved to us. We have in Gaius the
formula of investiture by which the universal successor was
created. We have the ancient name by which the person
afterwards called Heir was at first designated. We have
further the text of the celebrated clause in the Twelve
Tables by which the Testamentary power was expressly
recognised, and the clauses regulating Intestate Succession
have also been preserved. All these archaic phrases have one
salient peculiarity. They indicate that what passed from the
Testator to the Heir was the <i>Family</i>, that is, the aggregate
of rights and duties contained in the Patria Potestas and
growing out of it. The material property is in three instances
not mentioned at all; in two others, it is visibly named as
an adjunct or appendage of the Family. The original Will
or Testament was therefore an instrument, or (for it was
probably not at first in writing) a proceeding, by which the
devolution of the <i>Family</i> was regulated. It was a mode of
declaring who was to have the chieftainship, in succession to
the Testator. When Wills are understood to have this for
their original object, we see at once how it is that they came
to be connected with one of the most curious relics of ancient
religion and law, the <i>sacra</i>, or Family Rites. These <i>sacra</i> were
the Roman form of an institution which shows itself wherever
society has not wholly shaken itself free from its primitive
clothing. They are the sacrifices and ceremonies by which
the brotherhood of the family is commemorated, the pledge
and the witness of its perpetuity. Whatever be their nature,&mdash;whether
it be true or not that in all cases they are the
worship of some mythical ancestor,&mdash;they are everywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
employed to attest the sacredness of the family-relation; and
therefore they acquire prominent significance and importance,
whenever the continuous existence of the Family is endangered
by a change in the person of its chief. Accordingly
we hear most about them in connection with demises of
domestic sovereignty. Among the Hindoos, the right to
inherit a dead man's property is exactly co-extensive with
the duty of performing his obsequies. If the rites are not
properly performed or not performed by the proper person,
no relation is considered as established between the deceased
and anybody surviving him; the Law of Succession does not
apply, and nobody can inherit the property. Every great
event in the life of a Hindoo seems to be regarded as leading
up to and bearing upon those solemnities. If he marries, it
is to have children who may celebrate them after his death;
if he has no children, he lies under the strongest obligation
to adopt them from another family, "with a view," writes
the Hindoo doctor, "to the funeral cake, the water, and the
solemn sacrifice." The sphere preserved to the Roman <i>sacra</i>
in the time of Cicero, was not less in extent. It embraced
Inheritances and Adoptions. No Adoption was allowed to take
place without due provision for the <i>sacra</i> of the family from
which the adoptive son was transferred, and no Testament
was allowed to distribute an Inheritance without a strict
apportionment of the expenses of these ceremonies among
the different co-heirs. The differences between the Roman
law at this epoch, when we obtain our last glimpse of the
<i>sacra</i>, and the existing Hindoo system, are most instructive.
Among the Hindoos, the religious element in law has acquired
a complete predominance. Family sacrifices have
become the keystone of all the Law of Persons and much of
the Law of Things. They have even received a monstrous
extension, for it is a plausible opinion that the self-immolation
of the widow at her husband's funeral, a practice continued
to historical times by the Hindoos, and commemorated in
the traditions of several Indo-European races, was an addition
grafted on the primitive <i>sacra</i>, under the influence of the
impression, which always accompanies the idea of sacrifice,
that human blood is the most precious of all oblations. With
the Romans, on the contrary, the legal obligation and the
religious duty have ceased to be blended. The necessity of
solemnising the <i>sacra</i> forms no part of the theory of civil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
law, but they are under the separate jurisdiction of the College
of Pontiffs. The letters of Cicero to Atticus, which are full of
allusions to them, leave no doubt that they constituted an
intolerable burden on Inheritances; but the point of development
at which law breaks away from religion has been
passed, and we are prepared for their entire disappearance
from the later jurisprudence.</p>

<p>In Hindoo law there is no such thing as a true Will. The
place filled by Wills is occupied by Adoptions. We can now
see the relation of the Testamentary Power to the Faculty of
Adoption, and the reason why the exercise of either of them
could call up a peculiar solicitude for the performance of the
<i>sacra</i>. Both a Will and an Adoption threaten a distortion of
the ordinary course of Family descent, but they are obviously
contrivances for preventing the descent being wholly interrupted,
when there is no succession of kindred to carry it on.
Of the two expedients Adoption, the factitious creation of
blood-relationship, is the only one which has suggested itself
to the greater part of archaic societies. The Hindoos have
indeed advanced one point on what was doubtless the antique
practice, by allowing the widow to adopt when the father
has neglected to do so, and there are in the local customs of
Bengal some faint traces of the Testamentary powers. But
to the Romans belongs pre-eminently the credit of inventing
the Will, the institution which, next to the Contract, has
exercised the greatest influence in transforming human
society. We must be careful not to attribute to it in its
earliest shape the functions which have attended it in more
recent times. It was at first, not a mode of distributing a
dead man's goods, but one among several ways of transferring
the representation of the household to a new chief. The goods
descend no doubt to the Heir, but that is only because the
government of the family carries with it in its devolution the
power of disposing of the common stock. We are very far
as yet from that stage in the history of Wills in which they
become powerful instruments in modifying society through
the stimulus they give to the circulation of property and the
plasticity they produce in proprietary rights. No such consequences
as these appear in fact to have been associated
with the Testamentary power even by the latest Roman
lawyers. It will be found that Wills were never looked upon
in the Roman community as a contrivance for parting Property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and the Family, or for creating a variety of miscellaneous
interests, but rather as a means of making a better provision
for the members of a household than could be secured through
the rules of Intestate succession. We may suspect indeed
that the associations of a Roman with the practice of will-making
were extremely different from those familiar to us
nowadays. The habit of regarding Adoption and Testation
as modes of continuing the Family cannot but have had
something to do with the singular laxity of Roman notions
as to the inheritance of sovereignty. It is impossible not to
see that the succession of the early Roman Emperors to each
other was considered reasonably regular, and that, in spite
of all that had occurred, no absurdity attached to the pretension
of such Princes as Theodosius or Justinian to style
themselves C&aelig;sar and Augustus.</p>

<p>When the phenomena of primitive societies emerge into
light, it seems impossible to dispute a proposition which the
jurists of the seventeenth century considered doubtful, that
Intestate Inheritance is a more ancient institution than
Testamentary Succession. As soon as this is settled, a question
of much interest suggests itself, how and under what
conditions were the directions of a will first allowed to regulate
the devolution of authority over the household, and
consequently the posthumous distribution of property. The
difficulty of deciding the point arises from the rarity of
Testamentary power in archaic communities. It is doubtful
whether a true power of testation was known to any original
society except the Roman. Rudimentary forms of it occur
here and there, but most of them are not exempt from the
suspicion of a Roman origin. The Athenian will was, no
doubt, indigenous, but then, as will appear presently, it was
only an inchoate Testament. As to the Wills which are
sanctioned by the bodies of law which have descended to us
as the codes of the barbarian conquerors of Imperial Rome,
they are almost certainly Roman. The most penetrating
German criticism has recently been directed to these <i>leges
Barbarorum</i>, the great object of investigation being to detach
those portions of each system which formed the customs
of the tribe in its original home from the adventitious ingredients
which were borrowed from the laws of the Romans.
In the course of this process, one result has invariably disclosed
itself, that the ancient nucleus of the code contains no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
trace of a Will. Whatever testamentary law exists, has been
taken from Roman jurisprudence. Similarly, the rudimentary
Testament which (as I am informed) the Rabbinical Jewish
law provides for, has been attributed to contact with the
Romans. The only form of testament, not belonging to a
Roman or Hellenic society, which can reasonably be supposed
indigenous, is that recognised by the usages of the province
of Bengal; and the testament of Bengal is only a rudimentary
Will.</p>

<p>The evidence, however, such as it is, seems to point to the
conclusion that Testaments are at first only allowed to take
effect on failure of the persons entitled to have the inheritance
by right of blood genuine or fictitious. Thus, when Athenian
citizens were empowered for the first time by the Laws of
Solon to execute Testaments, they were forbidden to disinherit
their direct male descendants. So, too, the Will of
Bengal is only permitted to govern the succession so far as it
is consistent with certain overriding claims of the family.
Again, the original institutions of the Jews having provided
nowhere for the privileges of Testatorship, the later Rabbinical
jurisprudence, which pretends to supply the <i>casus omissi</i>
of the Mosaic law, allows the Power of Testation to attach
when all the kindred entitled under the Mosaic system to
succeed have failed or are undiscoverable. The limitations
by which the ancient German codes hedge in the testamentary
jurisprudence which has been incorporated with them are
also significant, and point in the same direction. It is the
peculiarity of most of these German laws, in the only shape
in which we know them, that, besides the <i>allod</i> or domain of
each household, they recognise several subordinate kinds or
orders of property, each of which probably represents a
separate transfusion of Roman principles into the primitive
body of Teutonic usage. The primitive German or allodial
property is strictly reserved to the kindred. Not only is it
incapable of being disposed of by testament but it is scarcely
capable of being alienated by conveyance <i>inter vivos</i>. The
ancient German law, like the Hindoo jurisprudence, makes
the male children co-proprietors with their father, and the
endowment of the family cannot be parted with except by
the consent of all its members. But the other sorts of property,
of more modern origin and lower dignity than the allodial
possessions, are much more easily alienated than they, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
follow much more lenient rules of devolution. Women and
the descendants of women succeed to them, obviously on the
principle that they lie outside the sacred precinct of the
Agnatic brotherhood. Now, it is on these last descriptions
of property, and on these only, that the Testaments borrowed
from Rome were at first allowed to operate.</p>

<p>These few indications may serve to lend additional plausibility
to that which in itself appears to be the most probable
explanation of an ascertained fact in the early history of
Roman Wills. We have it stated on abundant authority that
Testaments, during the primitive period of the Roman State,
were executed in the Comitia Calata, that is, in the Comitia
Curiata, or Parliament of the Patrician Burghers of Rome,
when assembled for Private Business. This mode of execution
has been the source of the assertion, handed down by one
generation of civilians to another, that every Will at one era
of Roman history was a solemn legislative enactment. But
there is no necessity whatever for resorting to an explanation
which has the defect of attributing far too much precision
to the proceedings of the ancient assembly. The proper key
to the story concerning the execution of Wills in the Comitia
Calata must no doubt be sought in the oldest Roman Law
of <i>intestate</i> succession. The canons of primitive Roman
jurisprudence regulating the inheritance of relations from
each other were, so long as they remained unmodified by the
Edictal Law of the Pr&aelig;tor, to the following effect:&mdash;First,
the <i>sui</i> or direct descendants who had never been emancipated
succeeded. On the failure of the <i>sui</i>, the Nearest Agnate came
into their place, that is, the nearest person or class of the
kindred who was or might have been under the same Patria
Potestas with the deceased. The third and last degree came
next, in which the inheritance devolved on the <i>gentiles</i>, that
is on the collective members of the dead man's <i>gens</i> or <i>House</i>.
The House, I have explained already, was a fictitious extension
of the family, consisting of all Roman Patrician citizens
who bore the same name, and who, on the ground of bearing
the same name, were supposed to be descended from a
common ancestor. Now the Patrician Assembly called the
Comitia Curiata was a Legislature in which Gentes or Houses
were exclusively represented. It was a representative assembly
of the Roman people, constituted on the assumption
that the constituent unit of the state was the Gens. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
being so, the inference seems inevitable, that the cognizance
of Wills by the Comitia was connected with the rights of the
Gentiles, and was intended to secure them in their privilege of
ultimate inheritance. The whole apparent anomaly is removed,
if we suppose that a Testament could only be made
when the testator had no <i>gentiles</i> discoverable, or when they
waived their claims, and that every Testament was submitted
to the General Assembly of the Roman Gentes, in
order that those aggrieved by its dispositions might put their
veto upon it if they pleased, or by allowing it to pass might
be presumed to have renounced their reversion. It is possible
that on the eve of the publication of the Twelve Tables this
vetoing power may have been greatly curtailed or only
occasionally and capriciously exercised. It is much easier,
however, to indicate the meaning and origin of the jurisdiction
confided to the Comitia Calata, than to trace its gradual
development or progressive decay.</p>

<p>The Testament to which the pedigree of all modern Wills
may be traced is not, however, the Testament executed in the
Calata Comitia, but another Testament designed to compete
with it and destined to supersede it. The historical importance
of this early Roman Will, and the light it casts on much of
ancient thought, will excuse me for describing it at some
length.</p>

<p>When the Testamentary power first discloses itself to us in
legal history, there are signs that, like almost all the great
Roman institutions, it was the subject of contention between
the Patricians and the Plebeians. The effect of the political
maxim, <i>Plebs Gentem non habet</i>, "a Plebeian cannot be a
member of a House," was entirely to exclude the Plebeians
from the Comitia Curiata. Some critics have accordingly
supposed that a Plebeian could not have his Will read or
recited to the Patrician Assembly, and was thus deprived
of Testamentary privileges altogether. Others have been
satisfied to point out the hardships of having to submit a
proposed Will to the unfriendly jurisdiction of an assembly
in which the Testator was not represented. Whatever be
the true view, a form of Testament came into use, which has
all the characteristics of a contrivance intended to evade
some distasteful obligation. The Will in question was a conveyance
<i>inter vivos</i>, a complete and irrevocable alienation of
the Testator's family and substance to the person whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
meant to be his heir. The strict rules of Roman law must
always have permitted such an alienation, but, when the
transaction was intended to have a posthumous effect, there
may have been disputes whether it was valid for Testamentary
purposes without the formal assent of the Patrician
Parliament. If a difference of opinion existed on the point
between the two classes of the Roman population, it was
extinguished, with many other sources of heartburning, by
the great Decemviral compromise. The text of the Twelve
Tables is still extant which says, "<i>Pater familias uti de
pecuni&acirc; tutel&acirc;ve rei su&aelig; leg&acirc;ssit, ita jus esto</i>"&mdash;a law which
can hardly have had any other object than the legalisation
of the Plebeian Will.</p>

<p>It is well known to scholars that, centuries after the Patrician
Assembly had ceased to be the legislature of the Roman
State, it still continued to hold formal sittings for the convenience
of private business. Consequently, at a period long
subsequent to the publication of the Decemviral Law, there
is reason to believe that the Comitia Calata still assembled
for the validation of Testaments. Its probable functions may
be best indicated by saying that it was a Court of Registration,
with the understanding however that the Wills exhibited
were not <i>enrolled</i>, but simply recited to the members, who
were supposed to take note of their tenor and to commit
them to memory. It is very likely that this form of Testament
was never reduced to writing at all, but at all events if the
Will had been originally written, the office of the Comitia
was certainly confined to hearing it read aloud, the document
being retained afterwards in the custody of the Testator,
or deposited under the safeguard of some religious corporation.
This publicity may have been one of the incidents of the
Testament executed in the Comitia Calata which brought it
into popular disfavour. In the early years of the Empire the
Comitia still held its meetings, but they seem to have lapsed
into the merest form, and few Wills, or none, were probably
presented at the periodical sitting.</p>

<p>It is the ancient Plebeian Will&mdash;the alternative of the
Testament just described&mdash;which in its remote effects has
deeply modified the civilisation of the modern world. It
acquired at Rome all the popularity which the Testament
submitted to the Calata Comitia appears to have lost. The
key to all its characteristics lies in its descent from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
<i>mancipium</i>, or ancient Roman conveyance, a proceeding to
which we may unhesitatingly assign the parentage of two
great institutions without which modern society can scarcely
be supposed capable of holding together, the Contract and the
Will. The <i>mancipium</i>, or as the word would exhibit itself
in later Latinity, the Mancipation, carries us back by its incidents
to the infancy of civil society. As it sprang from
times long anterior, if not to the invention, at all events to
the popularisation, of the art of writing, gestures, symbolical
acts, and solemn phrases take the place of documentary
forms, and a lengthy and intricate ceremonial is intended to
call the attention of the parties to the importance of the
transaction, and to impress it on the memory of the witnesses.
The imperfection too of oral, as compared with written,
testimony necessitates the multiplication of the witnesses
and assistants beyond what in later times would be reasonable
or intelligible limits.</p>

<p>The Roman Mancipation required the presence first of all
of the parties, the vendor and vendee, or we should perhaps
rather say, if we are to use modern legal language, the grantor
and grantee. There were also no less than <i>five</i> witnesses; and
an anomalous personage, the Libripens, who brought with
him a pair of scales to weigh the uncoined copper money
of ancient Rome. The Testament we are considering&mdash;the
Testament <i>per &aelig;s et libram</i>, "with the copper and the scales,"
as it long continued to be technically called&mdash;was an ordinary
Mancipation with no change in the form and hardly
any in words. The Testator was the grantor; the five witnesses
and the libripens were present; and the place of
grantee was taken by a person known technically as the
<i>famili&aelig; emptor</i>, the Purchaser of the Family. The ordinary
ceremony of a Mancipation was then proceeded with. Certain
formal gestures were made and sentences pronounced. The
<i>Emptor famili&aelig;</i> simulated the payment of a price by striking
the scales with a piece of money, and finally the Testator
ratified what had been done in a set form of words called the
"Nuncupatio" or publication of the transaction, a phrase
which, I need scarcely remind the lawyer, has had a long
history in Testamentary jurisprudence. It is necessary to
attend particularly to the character of the person called
<i>famili&aelig; emptor</i>. There is no doubt that at first he was the
Heir himself. The Testator conveyed to him outright his whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
"familia," that is, all the rights he enjoyed over and through
the family; his property, his slaves, and all his ancestral
privileges, together, on the other hand, with all his duties
and obligations.</p>

<p>With these data before us, we are able to note several
remarkable points in which the Mancipatory Testament,
as it may be called, differed in its primitive form from a
modern will. As it amounted to a conveyance <i>out-and-out</i> of
the Testator's estate, it was not <i>revocable</i>. There could be
no new exercise of a power which had been exhausted.</p>

<p>Again, it was not secret. The Famili&aelig; Emptor, being himself
the Heir, knew exactly what his rights were, and was
aware that he was irreversibly entitled to the inheritance;
a knowledge which the violences inseparable from the best-ordered
ancient society rendered extremely dangerous. But
perhaps the most surprising consequence of this relation of
Testaments to Conveyances was the immediate vesting of
the inheritance in the Heir. This has seemed so incredible
to not a few civilians, that they have spoken of the Testator's
estate as vesting conditionally on the Testator's death or
as granted to him from a time uncertain, <i>i.e.</i> the death of
the grantor. But down to the latest period of Roman jurisprudence
there was a certain class of transactions which
never admitted of being directly modified by a condition, or
of being limited to or from a point of time. In technical language
they did not admit <i>conditio</i> or <i>dies</i>. Mancipation was
one of them, and therefore, strange as it may seem, we are
forced to conclude that the primitive Roman Will took effect
at once, even though the Testator survived his act of Testation.
It is indeed likely that Roman citizens originally made
their Wills only in the article of death, and that a provision
for the continuance of the Family effected by a man in the
flower of life would take the form rather of an Adoption than
of a Will. Still we must believe that, if the Testator did recover,
he could only continue to govern his household by the
sufferance of his Heir.</p>

<p>Two or three remarks should be made before I explain how
these inconveniences were remedied, and how Testaments
came to be invested with the characteristics now universally
associated with them. The Testament was not necessarily
written: at first, it seems to have been invariably oral, and,
even in later times, the instrument declaratory of the bequests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
was only incidentally connected with the Will and formed no
essential part of it. It bore in fact exactly the same relation
to the Testament, which the deed leading the uses bore
to the Fines and Recoveries of old English law, or which the
charter of feoffment bore to the feoffment itself. Previously,
indeed, to the Twelve Tables, no writing would have been of
the slightest use, for the Testator had no power of giving
legacies, and the only persons who could be advantaged by a
will were the Heir or Co-heirs. But the extreme generality
of the clause in the Twelve Tables soon produced the doctrine
that the Heir must take the inheritance burdened by any
directions which the Testator might give him, or in other
words, take it subject to legacies. Written testamentary
instruments assumed thereupon a new value, as a security
against the fraudulent refusal of the heir to satisfy the legatees;
but to the last it was at the Testator's pleasure to rely
exclusively on the testimony of the witnesses, and to declare
by word of mouth the legacies which the <i>famili&aelig; emptor</i>
was commissioned to pay.</p>

<p>The terms of the expression <i>Emptor famili&aelig;</i> demand
notice. "Emptor" indicates that the Will was literally a
sale, and the word "famili&aelig;," when compared with the
phraseology in the Testamentary clause in the Twelve Tables,
leads us to some instructive conclusions. "Familia," in
classical Latinity, means always a man's slaves. Here, however,
and generally in the language of ancient Roman law,
it includes all persons under his Potestas, and the Testator's
material property or substance is understood to pass as an
adjunct or appendage of his household. Turning to the law
of the Twelve Tables, it will be seen that it speaks of <i>tutela
rei su&aelig;</i>, "the guardianship of his substance," a form of
expression which is the exact reverse of the phrase just
examined. There does not therefore appear to be any mode
of escaping from the conclusion, that, even at an era so
comparatively recent as that of the Decemviral compromise,
terms denoting "household" and "property" were blended
in the current phraseology. If a man's household had been
spoken of as his property we might have explained the
expression as pointing to the extent of the Patria Potestas,
but, as the interchange is reciprocal, we must allow that the
form of speech carries us back to that primeval period in
which property is owned by the family, and the family is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
governed by the citizen, so that the members of the community
do not own their property <i>and</i> their family, but rather
own their property <i>through</i> their family.</p>

<p>At an epoch not easy to settle with precision, the Roman
Pr&aelig;tors fell into the habit of acting upon Testaments solemnised
in closer conformity with the spirit than the letter of the
law. Casual dispensations became insensibly the established
practice, till at length a wholly new form of Will was matured
and regularly engrafted on the Edictal Jurisprudence. The
new or <i>Pr&aelig;torian</i> Testament derived the whole of its impregnability
from the <i>Jus Honorarium</i> or Equity of Rome. The
Pr&aelig;tor of some particular year must have inserted a clause
in his inaugural Proclamation declaratory of his intention to
sustain all Testaments which should have been executed with
such and such solemnities; and, the reform having been
found advantageous, the article relating to it must have been
again introduced by the Pr&aelig;tor's successor, and repeated by
the next in office, till at length it formed a recognised portion
of that body of jurisprudence which from these successive
incorporations was styled the Perpetual or Continuous Edict.
On examining the conditions of a valid Pr&aelig;torian Will they
will be plainly seen to have been determined by the requirements
of the Mancipatory Testament, the innovating Pr&aelig;tor
having obviously prescribed to himself the retention of the old
formalities just so far as they were warrants of genuineness or
securities against fraud. At the execution of the Mancipatory
Testament seven persons had been present besides the
Testator. Seven witnesses were accordingly essential to the
Pr&aelig;torian Will: two of them corresponding to the <i>libripens</i>
and <i>famili&aelig; emptor</i>, who were now stripped of their symbolical
character, and were merely present for the purpose of supplying
their testimony. No emblematic ceremony was gone
through; the Will was merely recited; but then it is probable
(though not absolutely certain) that a written instrument was
necessary to perpetuate the evidence of the Testator's dispositions.
At all events, whenever a writing was read or
exhibited as a person's last Will, we know certainly that the
Pr&aelig;torian Court would not sustain it by special intervention,
unless each of the seven witnesses had severally affixed his
seal to the outside. This is the first appearance of <i>sealing</i>
in the history of jurisprudence, considered as a mode of
authentication. It is to be observed that the seals of Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Wills, and other documents of importance, did not simply
serve as the index of the presence or assent of the signatory,
but were literally fastenings which had to be broken before the
writing could be inspected.</p>

<p>The Edictal Law would therefore enforce the dispositions
of a Testator, when, instead of being symbolised through the
forms of mancipation, they were simply evidenced by the
seals of seven witnesses. But it may be laid down as a general
proposition, that the principal qualities of Roman property
were incommunicable except through processes which were
supposed to be coeval with the origin of the Civil Law. The
Pr&aelig;tor therefore could not confer an <i>Inheritance</i> on anybody.
He could not place the Heir or Co-heirs in that very relation
in which the Testator had himself stood to his own rights
and obligations. All he could do was to confer on the person
designated as Heir the practical enjoyment of the property
bequeathed, and to give the force of legal acquittances to his
payments of the Testator's debts. When he exerted his powers
to these ends, the Pr&aelig;tor was technically said to communicate
the <i>Bonorum Possessio</i>. The Heir specially inducted under
these circumstances, or <i>Bonorum Possessor</i>, had every proprietary
privilege of the Heir by the Civil Law. He took
the profits and he could alienate, but then, for all his remedies
for redress against wrong, he must go, as we should phrase
it, not to the Common Law, but to the Equity side of the
Pr&aelig;torian Court. No great chance of error would be incurred
by describing him as having an <i>equitable</i> estate in the inheritance;
but then, to secure ourselves against being deluded
by the analogy, we must always recollect that in one year
the <i>Bonorum Possessio</i> was operated upon a principle of
Roman Law known as Usucapion, and the Possessor became
Quiritarian owner of all the property comprised in the
inheritance.</p>

<p>We know too little of the older law of Civil Process to be
able to strike the balance of advantage and disadvantage
between the different classes of remedies supplied by the
Pr&aelig;torian Tribunal. It is certain, however, that, in spite of
its many defects, the Mancipatory Testament by which the
<i>universitas juris</i> devolved at once and unimpaired was never
entirely superseded by the new Will; and at a period less
bigoted to antiquarian forms, and perhaps not quite alive to
their significance, all the ingenuity of the Jurisconsults seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
to have been expended on the improvement of the more
venerable instrument. At the era of Gaius, which is that of
the Antonine C&aelig;sars, the great blemishes of the Mancipatory
Will had been removed. Originally, as we have seen, the
essential character of the formalities had required that the
Heir himself should be the Purchaser of the Family, and
the consequence was that he not only instantly acquired a
vested interest in the Testator's Property, but was formally
made aware of his rights. But the age of Gaius permitted
some unconcerned person to officiate as Purchaser of the
Family. The heir, therefore, was not necessarily informed of
the succession to which he was destined; and Wills thenceforward
acquired the property of <i>secrecy</i>. The substitution of
a stranger for the actual Heir in the functions of "Famili&aelig;
Emptor" had other ulterior consequences. As soon as it was
legalised, a Roman Testament came to consist of two parts or
stages&mdash;a conveyance, which was a pure form, and a Nuncupatio,
or Publication. In this latter passage of the proceeding,
the Testator either orally declared to the assistants
the wishes which were to be executed after his death, or
produced a written document in which his wishes were
embodied. It was not probably till attention had been quite
drawn off from the imaginary Conveyance, and concentrated
on the Nuncupation as the essential part of the transaction,
that Wills were allowed to become <i>revocable</i>.</p>

<p>I have thus carried the pedigree of Wills some way down
in legal history. The root of it is the old Testament "with
the copper and the scales," founded on a Mancipation or
Conveyance. This ancient Will has, however, manifold defects,
which are remedied, though only indirectly, by the Pr&aelig;torian
law. Meantime the ingenuity of the Jurisconsults effects, in
the Common-Law Will or Mancipatory Testament, the very
improvements which the Pr&aelig;tor may have concurrently
carried out in Equity. These last ameliorations depend,
however, on mere legal dexterity, and we see accordingly that
the Testamentary Law of the day of Gaius or Ulpian is only
transitional. What changes next ensued we know not; but
at length, just before the reconstruction of the jurisprudence
by Justinian, we find the subjects of the Eastern Roman
Empire employing a form of Will of which the pedigree is
traceable to the Pr&aelig;torian Testament on one side, and to the
Testament "with the copper and the scales" on the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Like the Testament of the Pr&aelig;tor, it required no Mancipation,
and was invalid unless sealed by seven witnesses. Like the
Mancipatory Will, it passed the Inheritance and not merely
a <i>Bonorum Possessio</i>. Several, however, of its most important
features were annexed by positive enactments, and it is
out of regard to this threefold derivation from the Pr&aelig;torian
Edict, from the Civil Law, and from the Imperial Constitutions,
that Justinian speaks of the Law of Wills in his own
day as <i>Jus Tripertitum</i>. The new Testament thus described
is the one generally known as the Roman Will. But it was
the Will of the Eastern Empire only; and the researches of
Savigny have shown that in Western Europe the old Mancipatory
Testament, with all its apparatus of conveyance, copper,
and scales, continued to be the form in use far down in the
Middle Ages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">ancient and modern ideas respecting wills and
successions</span></h4>


<p>Although there is much in the modern European Law of
Wills which is intimately connected with the oldest rules of
Testamentary disposition practised among men, there are
nevertheless some important differences between ancient and
modern ideas on the subject of Wills and Successions. Some
of the points of difference I shall endeavour to illustrate in
this chapter.</p>

<p>At a period, removed several centuries from the era of the
Twelve Tables, we find a variety of rules engrafted on the
Roman Civil Law with the view of limiting the disinherison of
children; we have the jurisdiction of the Pr&aelig;tor very actively
exerted in the same interest; and we are also presented with
a new remedy, very anomalous in character and of uncertain
origin, called the Querela Inofficiosi Testamenti, "the Plaint
of an Unduteous Will," directed to the reinstatement of the
issue in inheritances from which they had been unjustifiably
excluded by a father's Testament. Comparing this condition
of the law with the text of the Twelve Tables which concedes
in terms the utmost liberty of Testation, several writers have
been tempted to interweave a good deal of dramatic incident
into their history of the Law Testamentary. They tell us of
the boundless license of disinherison in which the heads of
families instantly began to indulge, of the scandal and injury
to public morals which the new practices engendered, and of
the applause of all good men which hailed the courage of the
Pr&aelig;tor in arresting the progress of paternal depravity. This
story, which is not without some foundation for the principal
fact it relates, is often so told as to disclose very serious
misconceptions of the principles of legal history. The Law
of the Twelve Tables is to be explained by the character
of the age in which it was enacted. It does not license a
tendency which a later era thought itself bound to counteract,
but it proceeds on the assumption that no such tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
exists, or, perhaps we should say, in ignorance of the possibility
of its existence. There is no likelihood that Roman
citizens began immediately to avail themselves freely of the
power to disinherit. It is against all reason and sound appreciation
of history to suppose that the yoke of family bondage,
still patiently submitted to, as we know, where its pressure
galled most cruelly, would be cast off in the very particular in
which its incidence in our own day is not otherwise than
welcome. The Law of the Twelve Tables permitted the
execution of Testaments in the only case in which it was
thought possible that they could be executed, viz. on failure
of children and proximate kindred. It did not forbid the
disinherison of direct descendants, inasmuch as it did not
legislate against a contingency which no Roman lawgiver of
that era could have contemplated. No doubt, as the offices
of family affection progressively lost the aspect of primary
personal duties, the disinherison of children was occasionally
attempted. But the interference of the Pr&aelig;tor, so far from
being called for by the universality of the abuse, was doubtless
first prompted by the fact that such instances of unnatural
caprice were few and exceptional, and at conflict with the
current morality.</p>

<p>The indications furnished by this part of Roman Testamentary
Law are of a very different kind. It is remarkable
that a Will never seems to have been regarded by the Romans
as a means of <i>disinheriting</i> a Family, or of effecting the unequal
distribution of a patrimony. The rules of law preventing
its being turned to such a purpose, increase in number and
stringency as the jurisprudence unfolds itself; and these
rules correspond doubtless with the abiding sentiment of
Roman society, as distinguished from occasional variations
of feeling in individuals. It would rather seem as if the
Testamentary Power were chiefly valued for the assistance
it gave in <i>making provision</i> for a Family, and in dividing the
inheritance more evenly and fairly than the Law of Intestate
Succession would have divided it. If this be the true
reading of the general sentiment on the point, it explains to
some extent the singular horror of Intestacy which always
characterised the Roman. No evil seems to have been considered
a heavier visitation than the forfeiture of Testamentary
privileges; no curse appears to have been bitterer
than that which imprecated on an enemy that he might die<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
without a Will. The feeling has no counterpart, or none that
is easily recognisable, in the forms of opinion which exist
at the present day. All men at all times will doubtless prefer
chalking out the destination of their substance to having that
office performed for them by the law; but the Roman passion
for Testacy is distinguished from the mere desire to indulge
caprice by its intensity; and it has of course nothing whatever
in common with that pride of family, exclusively the
creation of feudalism, which accumulates one description of
property in the hands of a single representative. It is probable,
<i>&agrave; priori</i>, that it was something in the rules of Intestate Succession
which caused this vehement preference for the distribution
of property under a Testament over its distribution
by law. The difficulty, however, is, that on glancing at the
Roman Law of Intestate Succession, in the form which it
wore for many centuries before Justinian shaped it into that
scheme of inheritance which has been almost universally
adopted by modern lawgivers, it by no means strikes one as
remarkably unreasonable or inequitable. On the contrary,
the distribution it prescribes is so fair and rational, and differs
so little from that with which modern society has been
generally contented, that no reason suggests itself why it
should have been regarded with extraordinary distaste,
especially under a jurisprudence which pared down to a
narrow compass the testamentary privileges of persons who
had children to provide for. We should rather have expected
that, as in France at this moment, the heads of families would
generally save themselves the trouble of executing a Will,
and allow the Law to do as it pleased with their assets. I
think, however, if we look a little closely at the pre-Justinianean
scale of Intestate Succession, we shall discover
the key to the mystery. The texture of the law consists of
two distinct parts. One department of rules comes from the
Jus Civile, the Common-Law of Rome; the other from the
Edict of the Pr&aelig;tor. The Civil Law, as I have already stated
for another purpose, calls to the inheritance only three orders
of successors in their turn; the Unemancipated children, the
nearest class of Agnatic kindred, and the Gentiles. Between
these three orders, the Pr&aelig;tor interpolates various classes of
relatives, of whom the Civil Law took no notice whatever.
Ultimately, the combination of the Edict and of the Civil
Law forms a table of succession not materially different from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
that which has descended to the generality of modern
codes.</p>

<p>The point for recollection is that there must anciently have
been a time at which the rules of the Civil Law determined
the scheme of Intestate Succession exclusively, and at which
the arrangements of the Edict were non-existent, or not
consistently carried out. We cannot doubt that, in its infancy,
the Pr&aelig;torian jurisprudence had to contend with formidable
obstructions, and it is more than probable that, long after
popular sentiment and legal opinion had acquiesced in it,
the modifications which it periodically introduced were
governed by no certain principles, and fluctuated with the
varying bias of successive magistrates. The rules of Intestate
Succession, which the Romans must at this period have
practised, account, I think&mdash;and more than account&mdash;for
that vehement distaste for an Intestacy to which Roman
society during so many ages remained constant. The order
of succession was this: on the death of a citizen, having no
will or no valid will, his Unemancipated children became his
Heirs. His <i>emancipated</i> sons had no share in the inheritance.
If he left no direct descendants living at his death, the nearest
grade of the Agnatic kindred succeeded, but no part of the
inheritance was given to any relative united (however closely)
with the dead man through female descents. All the other
branches of the family were excluded, and the inheritance
escheated to the <i>Gentiles</i>, or entire body of Roman citizens
bearing the same name with the deceased. So that on failing
to execute an operative Testament, a Roman of the era under
examination left his emancipated children absolutely without
provision, while, on the assumption that he died childless,
there was imminent risk that his possessions would escape
from the family altogether, and devolve on a number of
persons with whom he was merely connected by the sacerdotal
fiction that assumed all members of the same <i>gens</i> to be
descended from a common ancestor. The prospect of such an
issue is in itself a nearly sufficient explanation of the popular
sentiment; but, in point of fact, we shall only half understand
it, if we forget that the state of things I have been describing
is likely to have existed at the very moment when Roman
society was in the first stage of its transition from its primitive
organisation in detached families. The empire of the father
had indeed received one of the earliest blows directed at it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
through the recognition of Emancipation as a legitimate
usage, but the law, still considering the Patria Potestas to be
the root of family connection, persevered in looking on the
emancipated children as strangers to the rights of Kinship
and aliens from the blood. We cannot, however, for a moment
suppose that the limitations of the family imposed by legal
pedantry had their counterpart in the natural affection of
parents. Family attachments must still have retained that
nearly inconceivable sanctity and intensity which belonged to
them under the Patriarchal system; and, so little are they
likely to have been extinguished by the act of emancipation,
that the probabilities are altogether the other way. It may
be unhesitatingly taken for granted that enfranchisement
from the father's power was a demonstration, rather than a
severance, of affection&mdash;a mark of grace and favour accorded
to the best-beloved and most esteemed of the children. If
sons thus honoured above the rest were absolutely deprived
of their heritage by an Intestacy, the reluctance to incur it
requires no farther explanation. We might have assumed <i>&agrave;
priori</i> that the passion for Testacy was generated by some
moral injustice entailed by the rules of Intestate succession;
and here we find them at variance with the very instinct by
which early society was cemented together. It is possible to
put all that has been urged in a very succinct form. Every
dominant sentiment of the primitive Romans was entwined
with the relations of the family. But what was the Family?
The Law defined it one way&mdash;natural affection another. In the
conflict between the two, the feeling we would analyse grew up,
taking the form of an enthusiasm for the institution by which
the dictates of affection were permitted to determine the
fortunes of its objects.</p>

<p>I regard, therefore, the Roman horror of Intestacy as a
monument of a very early conflict between ancient law and
slowly changing ancient sentiment on the subject of the
Family. Some passages in the Roman Statute-Law, and one
statute in particular which limited the capacity for inheritance
possessed by women, must have contributed to keep
alive the feeling; and it is the general belief that the system
of creating Fidei-Commissa, or bequests in trust, was devised
to evade the disabilities imposed by those statutes. But the
feeling itself, in its remarkable intensity, seems to point back
to some deeper antagonism between law and opinion; nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
is it at all wonderful that the improvements of jurisprudence
by the Pr&aelig;tor should not have extinguished it. Everybody
conversant with the philosophy of opinion is aware that a
sentiment by no means dies out, of necessity, with the passing
away of the circumstances which produced it. It may long
survive them; nay, it may afterwards attain to a pitch and
climax of intensity which it never attained during their actual
continuance.</p>

<p>The view of a Will which regards it as conferring the power
of diverting property from the Family, or of distributing it
in such uneven proportions as the fancy or good sense of the
Testator may dictate, is not older than that later portion of
the Middle Ages in which Feudalism had completely consolidated
itself. When modern jurisprudence first shows itself
in the rough, Wills are rarely allowed to dispose with absolute
freedom of a dead man's assets. Wherever at this period
the descent of property was regulated by Will&mdash;and over the
greater part of Europe moveable or personal property was
the subject of Testamentary disposition&mdash;the exercise of the
Testamentary power was seldom allowed to interfere with
the right of the widow to a definite share, and of the children
to certain fixed proportions, of the devolving inheritance. The
shares of the children, as their amount shows, were determined
by the authority of Roman law. The provision for the
widow was attributable to the exertions of the Church, which
never relaxed its solicitude for the interest of wives surviving
their husbands&mdash;winning, perhaps, one of the most arduous
of its triumphs when, after exacting for two or three centuries
an express promise from the husband at marriage to endow
his wife, it at length succeeded in engrafting the principle
of Dower on the Customary Law of all Western Europe.
Curiously enough, the dower of lands proved a more stable
institution than the analogous and more ancient reservation
of certain shares of the personal property to the widow and
children. A few local customs in France maintained the right
down to the Revolution, and there are traces of similar usages
in England; but on the whole the doctrine prevailed that
moveables might be freely disposed of by Will, and, even when
the claims of the widow continued to be respected, the privileges
of the children were obliterated from jurisprudence.
We need not hesitate to attribute the change to the influence
of Primogeniture. As the Feudal law of land practically disinherited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
all the children in favour of one, the equal distribution
even of those sorts of property which might have
been equally divided ceased to be viewed as a duty. Testaments
were the principal instruments employed in producing
inequality, and in this condition of things originated the
shade of difference which shows itself between the ancient
and the modern conception of a Will. But, though the liberty
of bequest, enjoyed through Testaments, was thus an accidental
fruit of Feudalism, there is no broader distinction
than that which exists between a system of free Testamentary
disposition and a system, like that of the Feudal land-law,
under which property descends compulsorily in prescribed
lines of devolution. This truth appears to have been lost sight
of by the authors of the French Codes. In the social fabric
which they determined to destroy, they saw Primogeniture
resting chiefly on Family settlements, but they also perceived
that Testaments were frequently employed to give the eldest
son precisely the same preference which was reserved to him
under the strictest of entails. In order, therefore, to make
sure of their work, they not only rendered it impossible to
prefer the eldest son to the rest in marriage-arrangements,
but they almost expelled Testamentary succession from the
law, lest it should be used to defeat their fundamental principle
of an equal distribution of property among children at
the parent's death. The result is that they have established
a system of small perpetual entails, which is infinitely nearer
akin to the system of feudal Europe than would be a perfect
liberty of bequest. The land-law of England, "the Herculaneum
of Feudalism," is certainly much more closely allied
to the land-law of the Middle Ages than that of any Continental
country, and Wills with us are frequently used to aid
or imitate that preference of the eldest son and his line which
is a nearly universal feature in marriage settlements of real
property. But nevertheless feeling and opinion in this country
have been profoundly affected by the practice of free Testamentary
disposition; and it appears to me that the state of
sentiment in a great part of French society, on the subject of
the conservation of property in families, is much liker that
which prevailed through Europe two or three centuries ago
than are the current opinions of Englishmen.</p>

<p>The mention of Primogeniture introduces one of the most
difficult problems of historical jurisprudence. Though I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
not paused to explain my expressions, it may have been
noticed that I have frequently spoken of a number of "co-heirs"
as placed by the Roman Law of Succession on the
same footing with a single Heir. In point of fact, we know of
no period of Roman jurisprudence at which the place of the
Heir, or Universal Successor, might not have been taken by
a group of co-heirs. This group succeeded as a single unit, and
the assets were afterwards divided among them in a separate
legal proceeding. When the Succession was <i>ab intestato</i>, and
the group consisted of the children of the deceased, they each
took an equal share of the property; nor, though males had
at one time some advantages over females, is there the faintest
trace of Primogeniture. The mode of distribution is the same
throughout archaic jurisprudence. It certainly seems that,
when civil society begins and families cease to hold together
through a series of generations, the idea which spontaneously
suggests itself is to divide the domain equally among the
members of each successive generation, and to reserve no
privilege to the eldest son or stock. Some peculiarly significant
hints as to the close relation of this phenomenon to
primitive thought are furnished by systems yet more archaic
than the Roman. Among the Hindoos, the instant a son is
born, he acquires a vested right in his father's property,
which cannot be sold without recognition of his joint ownership.
On the son's attaining full age, he can sometimes compel
a partition of the estate even against the consent of the
parent; and, should the parent acquiesce, one son can always
have a partition even against the will of the others. On such
partition taking place, the father has no advantage over his
children, except that he has two of the shares instead of one.
The ancient law of the German tribes was exceedingly similar.
The <i>allod</i> or domain of the family was the joint-property of
the father and his sons. It does not, however, appear to have
been habitually divided even at the death of the parent, and
in the same way the possessions of a Hindoo, however divisible
theoretically, are so rarely distributed in fact, that many
generations constantly succeed each other without a partition
taking place, and thus the Family in India has a perpetual
tendency to expand into the Village Community, under conditions
which I shall hereafter attempt to elucidate. All this
points very clearly to the absolutely equal division of assets
among the male children at death as the practice most usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
with society at the period when family-dependency is in the
first stages of disintegration. Here then emerges the historical
difficulty of Primogeniture. The more clearly we perceive
that, when the Feudal institutions were in process of formation,
there was no source in the world whence they could derive
their elements but the Roman law of the provincials on the
one hand and the archaic customs of the barbarians on the
other, the more are we perplexed at first sight by our knowledge
that neither Roman nor barbarian was accustomed to
give any preference to the eldest son or his line in the succession
to property.</p>

<p>Primogeniture did not belong to the Customs which the
barbarians practised on their first establishment within the
Roman Empire. It is known to have had its origin in the
<i>benefices</i> or beneficiary gifts of the invading chieftains. These
benefices, which were occasionally conferred by the earlier
immigrant kings, but were distributed on a great scale by
Charlemagne, were grants of Roman provincial land to be
holden by the beneficiary on condition of military service.
The <i>allodial</i> proprietors do not seem to have followed their
sovereign on distant or difficult enterprises, and all the grander
expeditions of the Frankish chiefs and of Charlemagne were
accomplished with forces composed of soldiers either personally
dependent on the royal house or compelled to serve it
by the tenure of their land. The benefices, however, were
not at first in any sense hereditary. They were held at the
pleasure of the grantor, or at most for the life of the grantee;
but still, from the very outset, no effort seems to have been
spared by the beneficiaries to enlarge the tenure, and to continue
their lands in their family after death. Through the
feebleness of Charlemagne's successors these attempts were
universally successful, and the Benefice gradually transformed
itself into the hereditary Fief. But, though the fiefs
were hereditary, they did not necessarily descend to the
eldest son. The rules of succession which they followed were
entirely determined by the terms agreed upon between the
grantor and the beneficiary, or imposed by one of them on
the weakness of the other. The original tenures were therefore
extremely various; not indeed so capriciously various as is
sometimes asserted, for all which have hitherto been described
present some combination of the modes of succession familiar
to Romans and to barbarians, but still exceedingly miscel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>laneous.
In some of them, the eldest son and his stock undoubtedly
succeeded to the fief before the others, but such
successions, so far from being universal, do not even appear
to have been general. Precisely the same phenomena recur
during that more recent transmutation of European society
which entirely substituted the feudal form of property for the
domainial (or Roman) and the allodial (or German). The
allods were wholly absorbed by the fiefs. The greater allodial
proprietors transformed themselves into feudal lords by conditional
alienations of portions of their land to dependants;
the smaller sought an escape from the oppressions of that
terrible time by surrendering their property to some powerful
chieftain, and receiving it back at his hands on condition of
service in his wars. Meantime, that vast mass of the population
of Western Europe whose condition was servile or semi-servile&mdash;the
Roman and German personal slaves, the Roman
<i>coloni</i> and the German <i>lidi</i>&mdash;were concurrently absorbed by
the feudal organisation, a few of them assuming a menial
relation to the lords, but the greater part receiving land on
terms which in those centuries were considered degrading.
The tenures created during this era of universal infeudation
were as various as the conditions which the tenants made
with their new chiefs or were forced to accept from them.
As in the case of the benefices, the succession to some, but by
no means to all, of the estates followed the rule of Primogeniture.
No sooner, however, has the feudal system prevailed
throughout the West, than it becomes evident that Primogeniture
has some great advantage over every other mode of
succession. It spread over Europe with remarkable rapidity,
the principal instrument of diffusion being Family Settlements,
the Pactes de Famille of France and Haus-Gesetze of
Germany, which universally stipulated that lands held by
knightly service should descend to the eldest son. Ultimately
the law resigned itself to follow inveterate practice, and we find
that in all the bodies of Customary Law, which were gradually
built up, the eldest son and stock are preferred in the succession
to estates of which the tenure is free and military. As to
lands held by servile tenures (and originally all tenures were
servile which bound the tenant to pay money or bestow
manual labour), the system of succession prescribed by
custom differed greatly in different countries and different
provinces. The more general rule was that such lands were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
divided equally at death among all the children, but still in
some instances the eldest son was preferred, in some the
youngest. But Primogeniture usually governed the inheritance
of that class of estates, in some respects the most important
of all, which were held by tenures that, like the
English Socage, were of later origin than the rest, and were
neither altogether free nor altogether servile.</p>

<p>The diffusion of Primogeniture is usually accounted for by
assigning what are called Feudal reasons for it. It is asserted
that the feudal superior had a better security for the military
service he required when the fief descended to a single person,
instead of being distributed among a number on the decease
of the last holder. Without denying that this consideration
may partially explain the favour gradually acquired by Primogeniture,
I must point out that Primogeniture became a
custom of Europe much more through its popularity with the
tenants than through any advantage it conferred on the lords.
For its origin, moreover, the reason given does not account
at all. Nothing in law springs entirely from a sense of convenience.
There are always certain ideas existing antecedently
on which the sense of convenience works, and of which it can
do no more than form some new combination; and to find
these ideas in the present case is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>A valuable hint is furnished to us from a quarter fruitful
of such indications. Although in India the possessions of a
parent are divisible at his death, and may be divisible during
his life, among all his male children in equal shares, and though
this principle of the equal distribution of <i>property</i> extends to
every part of the Hindoo institutions, yet wherever <i>public
office</i> or <i>political power</i> devolves at the decease of the last
Incumbent, the succession is nearly universally according to
the rules of Primogeniture. Sovereignties descend therefore
to the eldest son, and where the affairs of the Village Community,
the corporate unit of Hindoo society, are confided
to a single manager, it is generally the eldest son who takes
up the administration at his parent's death. All offices, indeed,
in India, tend to become hereditary, and, when their nature
permits it, to vest in the eldest member of the oldest stock.
Comparing these Indian successions with some of the ruder
social organisations which have survived in Europe almost
to our own day, the conclusion suggests itself that, when
Patriarchal power is not only <i>domestic</i> but <i>political</i>, it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
distributed among all the issue at the parent's death, but is
the birthright of the eldest son. The chieftainship of a Highland
clan, for example, followed the order of Primogeniture.
There seems, in truth, to be a form of family-dependency still
more archaic than any of those which we know from the
primitive records of organised civil societies. The Agnatic
Union of the kindred in ancient Roman law, and a multitude
of similar indications, point to a period at which all the ramifying
branches of the family tree held together in one organic
whole; and it is no presumptuous conjecture, that, when
the corporation thus formed by the kindred was in itself an
independent society, it was governed by the eldest male of
the oldest line. It is true that we have no actual knowledge
of any such society. Even in the most elementary communities,
family-organisations, as we know them, are at most
<i>imperia in imperio</i>. But the position of some of them, of the
Celtic clans in particular, was sufficiently near independence
within historical times to force on us the conviction that they
were once separate <i>imperia</i>, and that Primogeniture regulated
the succession to the chieftainship. It is, however,
necessary to be on our guard against modern associations
with the term of law. We are speaking of a family-connection
still closer and more stringent than any with which we are
made acquainted by Hindoo society or ancient Roman law.
If the Roman Paterfamilias was visibly steward of the family
possessions, if the Hindoo father is only joint-sharer with his
sons, still more emphatically must the true patriarchal chieftain
be merely the administrator of a common fund.</p>

<p>The examples of succession by Primogeniture which were
found among the Benefices may, therefore, have been imitated
from a system of family-government known to the invading
races, though not in general use. Some ruder tribes may have
still practised it, or, what is still more probable, society may
have been so slightly removed from its more archaic condition
that the minds of some men spontaneously recurred to it,
when they were called upon to settle the rules of inheritance
for a new form of property. But there is still the question,
Why did Primogeniture gradually supersede every other
principle of succession? The answer, I think, is, that European
society decidedly retrograded during the dissolution of the
Carlovingian empire. It sank a point or two back even from
the miserably low degree which it had marked during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
early barbarian monarchies. The great characteristic of the
period was the feebleness, or rather the abeyance, of kingly
and therefore of civil authority; and hence it seems as if,
civil society no longer cohering, men universally flung themselves
back on a social organisation older than the beginnings
of civil communities. The lord with his vassals, during the
ninth and tenth centuries, may be considered as a patriarchal
household, recruited, not as in the primitive times by Adoption,
but by Infeudation; and to such a confederacy, succession
by Primogeniture was a source of strength and durability.
So long as the land was kept together on which the entire
organisation rested, it was powerful for defence and attack;
to divide the land was to divide the little society, and voluntarily
to invite aggression in an era of universal violence. We
may be perfectly certain that into this preference for Primogeniture
there entered no idea of disinheriting the bulk of the
children in favour of one. Everybody would have suffered by
the division of the fief. Everybody was a gainer by its consolidation.
The Family grew stronger by the concentration
of power in the same hands; nor is it likely that the lord who
was invested with the inheritance had any advantage over
his brethren and kinsfolk in occupations, interests, or indulgences.
It would be a singular anachronism to estimate the
privileges succeeded to by the heir of a fief, by the situation
in which the eldest son is placed under an English strict
settlement.</p>

<p>I have said that I regard the early feudal confederacies as
descended from an archaic form of the Family, and as wearing
a strong resemblance to it. But then in the ancient world, and
in the societies which have not passed through the crucible of
feudalism, the Primogeniture which seems to have prevailed
never transformed itself into the Primogeniture of the later
feudal Europe. When the group of kinsmen ceased to be
governed through a series of generations by a hereditary chief,
the domain which had been managed for all appears to have
been equally divided among all. Why did this not occur in
the feudal world? If during the confusions of the first feudal
period the eldest son held the land for the behoof of the whole
family, why was it that when feudal Europe had consolidated
itself, and regular communities were again established, the
whole family did not resume that capacity for equal inheritance
which had belonged to Roman and German alike? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
key which unlocks this difficulty has rarely been seized by
the writers who occupy themselves in tracing the genealogy of
Feudalism. They perceive the materials of the feudal institutions,
but they miss the cement. The ideas and social forms
which contributed to the formation of the system were unquestionably
barbarian and archaic, but, as soon as Courts
and lawyers were called in to interpret and define it, the principles
of interpretation which they applied to it were those of
the latest Roman jurisprudence, and were therefore excessively
refined and matured. In a patriarchally governed
society, the eldest son may succeed to the government of the
Agnatic group, and to the absolute disposal of its property.
But he is not therefore a true proprietor. He has correlative
duties not involved in the conception of proprietorship, but
quite undefined and quite incapable of definition. The later
Roman jurisprudence, however, like our own law, looked
upon uncontrolled power over property as equivalent to
ownership, and did not, and, in fact, could not, take notice
of liabilities of such a kind, that the very conception of them
belonged to a period anterior to regular law. The contact of
the refined and the barbarous notion had inevitably for its
effect the conversion of the eldest son into legal proprietor of
the inheritance. The clerical and secular lawyers so defined
his position from the first; but it was only by insensible
degrees that the younger brother, from participating on equal
terms in all the dangers and enjoyments of his kinsman, sank
into the priest, the soldier of fortune, or the hanger-on of the
mansion. The legal revolution was identical with that which
occurred on a smaller scale, and in quite recent times, through
the greater part of the Highlands of Scotland. When called
in to determine the legal powers of the chieftain over the
domains which gave sustenance to the clan, Scottish jurisprudence
had long since passed the point at which it could
take notice of the vague limitations on completeness of
dominion imposed by the claims of the clansmen, and it was
inevitable therefore that it should convert the patrimony of
many into the estate of one.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity I have called the mode of succession
Primogeniture whenever a single son or descendant
succeeds to the authority over a household or society. It is
remarkable, however, that in the few very ancient examples
which remain to us of this sort of succession, it is not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the eldest son, in the sense familiar to us, who takes up the
representation. The form of Primogeniture which has spread
over Western Europe has also been perpetuated among the
Hindoos, and there is every reason to believe that it is the
normal form. Under it, not only the eldest son, but the eldest
line is always preferred. If the eldest son fails, his eldest son
has precedence not only over brothers but over uncles; and,
if he too fails, the same rule is followed in the next generation.
But when the succession is not merely to <i>civil</i> but to <i>political</i>
power, a difficulty may present itself which will appear of
greater magnitude according as the cohesion of society is less
perfect. The chieftain who last exercised authority may have
outlived his eldest son, and the grandson who is primarily
entitled to succeed may be too young and immature to undertake
the actual guidance of the community, and the administration
of its affairs. In such an event, the expedient which
suggests itself to the more settled societies is to place the
infant heir under guardianship till he reaches the age of
fitness for government. The guardianship is generally that
of the male Agnates; but it is remarkable that the contingency
supposed is one of the rare cases in which ancient
societies have consented to the exercise of power by women,
doubtless out of respect to the overshadowing claims of the
mother. In India, the widow of a Hindoo sovereign governs in
the name of her infant son, and we cannot but remember
that the custom regulating succession to the throne of France&mdash;which,
whatever be its origin, is doubtless of the highest
antiquity&mdash;preferred the queen-mother to all other claimants
for the Regency, at the same time that it rigorously excluded
all females from the throne. There is, however, another mode
of obviating the inconvenience attending the devolution of
sovereignty on an infant heir, and it is one which would
doubtless occur spontaneously to rudely organised communities.
This is to set aside the infant heir altogether, and
confer the chieftainship on the eldest surviving male of the
first generation. The Celtic clan-associations, among the
many phenomena which they have preserved of an age in
which civil and political society were not yet even rudimentarily
separated, have brought down this rule of succession
to historical times. With them, it seems to have existed
in the form of a positive canon, that, failing the eldest son, his
next brother succeeds in priority to all grandsons, whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
be their age at the moment when the sovereignty devolves.
Some writers have explained the principle by assuming that
the Celtic customs took the last chieftain as a sort of root or
stock, and then gave the succession to the descendant who
should be least remote from him; the uncle thus being preferred
to the grandson as being nearer to the common root.
No objection can be taken to this statement if it be merely
intended as a description of the system of succession; but it
would be a serious error to conceive the men who first adopted
the rule as applying a course of reasoning which evidently
dates from the time when feudal schemes of succession begun
to be debated among lawyers. The true origin of the preference
of the uncle to the grandson is doubtless a simple calculation
on the part of rude men in a rude society that it is
better to be governed by a grown chieftain than by a child,
and that the younger son is more likely to have come to
maturity than any of the eldest son's descendants. At the
same time, we have some evidence that the form of Primogeniture
with which we are best acquainted is the primary
form, in the tradition that the assent of the clan was asked
when an infant heir was passed over in favour of his uncle.
There is a tolerably well authenticated instance of this ceremony
in the annals of the Macdonalds.</p>

<p>Under Mahometan law, which has probably preserved an
ancient Arabian custom, inheritances of property are divided
equally among sons, the daughters taking a half share; but
if any of the children die before the division of the inheritance,
leaving issue behind, these grandchildren are entirely excluded
by their uncles and aunts. Consistently with this principle,
the succession, when political authority devolves, is according
to the form of Primogeniture which appears to have obtained
among the Celtic societies. In the two great Mahometan
families of the West, the rule is believed to be, that the uncle
succeeds to the throne in preference to the nephew, though
the latter be the son of an elder brother; but though this
rule has been followed quite recently in Egypt, I am informed
that there is some doubt as to its governing the devolution
of the Turkish sovereignty. The policy of the Sultans has
in fact hitherto prevented cases for its application from
occurring, and it is possible that their wholesale massacres
of their younger brothers may have been perpetuated quite
as much in the interest of their children as for the sake of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
making away with dangerous competitors for the throne.
It is evident, however, that in polygamous societies the form
of Primogeniture will always tend to vary. Many considerations
may constitute a claim on the succession, the rank of
the mother, for example, or her degree in the affections of
the father. Accordingly, some of the Indian Mahometan
sovereigns, without pretending to any distinct testamentary
power, claim the right of nominating the son who is to succeed.
The <i>blessing</i> mentioned in the Scriptural history of Isaac and
his sons has sometimes been spoken of as a will, but it seems
rather to have been a mode of naming an eldest son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the early history of property</span></h4>


<p>The Roman Institutional Treatises, after giving their definition
of the various forms and modifications of ownership,
proceed to discuss the Natural Modes of Acquiring Property.
Those who are unfamiliar with the history of jurisprudence
are not likely to look upon these "natural modes" of acquisition
as possessing, at first sight, either much speculative or
much practical interest. The wild animal which is snared or
killed by the hunter, the soil which is added to our field by
the imperceptible deposits of a river, the tree which strikes
its roots into our ground, are each said by the Roman lawyers
to be acquired by us <i>naturally</i>. The older jurisconsults had
doubtless observed that such acquisitions were universally
sanctioned by the usages of the little societies around them,
and thus the lawyers of a later age, finding them classed in
the ancient Jus Gentium, and perceiving them to be of the
simplest description, allotted them a place among the ordinances
of Nature. The dignity with which they were invested
has gone on increasing in modern times till it is quite out of
proportion to their original importance. Theory has made
them its favourite food, and has enabled them to exercise
the most serious influence on practice.</p>

<p>It will be necessary for us to attend to one only among these
"natural modes of acquisition," Occupatio or Occupancy.
Occupancy is the advisedly taking possession of that which
at the moment is the property of no man, with the view (adds
the technical definition) of acquiring property in it for yourself.
The objects which the Roman lawyers called <i>res nullius</i>&mdash;things
which have not or have never had an owner&mdash;can
only be ascertained by enumerating them. Among things
which <i>never had</i> an owner are wild animals, fishes, wild fowl,
jewels disinterred for the first time, and lands newly discovered
or never before cultivated. Among things which <i>have not</i>
an owner are moveables which have been abandoned, lands
which have been deserted, and (an anomalous but most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
formidable item) the property of an enemy. In all these
objects the full rights of dominion were acquired by the
<i>Occupant</i> who first took possession of them with the intention
of keeping them as his own&mdash;an intention which, in certain
cases, had to be manifested by specific acts. It is not difficult,
I think, to understand the universality which caused the
practice of Occupancy to be placed by one generation of
Roman lawyers in the Law common to all Nations, and the
simplicity which occasioned its being attributed by another
to the Law of Nature. But for its fortunes in modern legal
history we are less prepared by <i>&agrave; priori</i> considerations. The
Roman principle of Occupancy, and the rules into which the
jurisconsults expanded it, are the source of all modern International
Law on the subject of Capture in War and of the
acquisition of sovereign rights in newly discovered countries.
They have also supplied a theory of the Origin of Property,
which is at once the popular theory, and the theory which,
in one form or another, is acquiesced in by the great majority
of speculative jurists.</p>

<p>I have said that the Roman principle of Occupancy has
determined the tenor of that chapter of International Law
which is concerned with Capture in War. The Law of Warlike
Capture derives its rules from the assumption that communities
are remitted to a state of nature by the outbreak
of hostilities, and that, in the artificial natural condition
thus produced, the institution of private property falls into
abeyance so far as concerns the belligerents. As the later
writers on the Law of Nature have always been anxious to
maintain that private property was in some sense sanctioned
by the system which they were expounding, the hypothesis
that an enemy's property is <i>res nullius</i> has seemed to them
perverse and shocking, and they are careful to stigmatise
it as a mere fiction of jurisprudence. But, as soon as the
Law of Nature is traced to its source in the Jus Gentium, we
see at once how the goods of an enemy came to be looked upon
as nobody's property, and therefore as capable of being
acquired by the first occupant. The idea would occur
spontaneously to persons practising the ancient forms of
Warfare, when victory dissolved the organisation of the
conquering army and dismissed the soldiers to indiscriminate
plunder. It is probable, however, that originally it was only
moveable property which was thus permitted to be acquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
by the Captor. We know on independent authority that a very
different rule prevailed in ancient Italy as to the acquisition
of ownership in the soil of a conquered country, and we may
therefore suspect that the application of the principle of
occupancy to land (always a matter of difficulty) dates from
the period when the Jus Gentium was becoming the Code of
Nature, and that it is the result of a generalisation effected
by the jurisconsults of the golden age. Their dogmas on the
point are preserved in the Pandects of Justinian, and amount
to an unqualified assertion that enemy's property of every
sort is <i>res nullius</i> to the other belligerent, and that Occupancy,
by which the Captor makes them his own, is an institution
of Natural Law. The rules which International jurisprudence
derives from these positions have sometimes been stigmatised
as needlessly indulgent to the ferocity and cupidity of combatants,
but the charge has been made, I think, by persons
who are unacquainted with the history of wars, and who are
consequently ignorant how great an exploit it is to command
obedience for a rule of any kind. The Roman principle of
Occupancy, when it was admitted into the modern law of
Capture in War, drew with it a number of subordinate canons,
limiting and giving precision to its operation, and if the
contests which have been waged since the treatise of Grotius
became an authority, are compared with those of an earlier
date, it will be seen that, as soon as the Roman maxims were
received, Warfare instantly assumed a more tolerable complexion.
If the Roman law of Occupancy is to be taxed with
having had pernicious influence on any part of the modern
Law of Nations, there is another chapter in it which may be
said, with some reason, to have been injuriously affected.
In applying to the discovery of new countries the same
principles which the Romans had applied to the finding of
a jewel, the Publicists forced into their service a doctrine
altogether unequal to the task expected from it. Elevated
into extreme importance by the discoveries of the great
navigators of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it raised
more disputes than it solved. The greatest uncertainty was
very shortly found to exist on the very two points on which
certainty was most required, the extent of the territory which
was acquired for his sovereign by the discoverer, and the
nature of the acts which were necessary to complete the
<i>adprehensio</i> or assumption of sovereign possession. Moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the principle itself, conferring as it did such enormous
advantages as the consequence of a piece of good luck, was
instinctively mutinied against by some of the most adventurous
nations in Europe, the Dutch, the English, and the Portuguese.
Our own countrymen, without expressly denying
the rule of International Law, never did, in practice, admit
the claim of the Spaniards to engross the whole of America
south of the Gulf of Mexico, or that of the King of France to
monopolise the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi. From
the accession of Elizabeth to the accession of Charles the
Second, it cannot be said that there was at any time thorough
peace in the American waters, and the encroachments of the
New England Colonists on the territory of the French King
continued for almost a century longer. Bentham was so
struck with the confusion attending the application of the
legal principle, that he went out of his way to eulogise the
famous Bull of Pope Alexander the Sixth, dividing the undiscovered
countries of the world between the Spaniards and
Portuguese by a line drawn one hundred leagues West of
the Azores; and, grotesque as his praises may appear at
first sight, it may be doubted whether the arrangement of
Pope Alexander is absurder in principle than the rule of
Public law, which gave half a continent to the monarch whose
servants had fulfilled the conditions required by Roman
jurisprudence for the acquisition of property in a valuable
object which could be covered by the hand.</p>

<p>To all who pursue the inquiries which are the subject of
this volume, Occupancy is pre-eminently interesting on the
score of the service it has been made to perform for speculative
jurisprudence, in furnishing a supposed explanation of the
origin of private property. It was once universally believed
that the proceeding implied in Occupancy was identical with
the process by which the earth and its fruits, which were at
first in common, became the allowed property of individuals.
The course of thought which led to this assumption is not
difficult to understand, if we seize the shade of difference
which separates the ancient from the modern conception of
Natural Law. The Roman lawyers had laid down that
Occupancy was one of the Natural modes of acquiring
property, and they undoubtedly believed that, were mankind
living under the institutions of Nature, Occupancy would be
one of their practices. How far they persuaded themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
that such a condition of the race had ever existed, is a point,
as I have already stated, which their language leaves in much
uncertainty; but they certainly do seem to have made the
conjecture, which has at all times possessed much plausibility,
that the institution of property was not so old as the existence
of mankind. Modern jurisprudence, accepting all their
dogmas without reservation, went far beyond them in the
eager curiosity with which it dwelt on the supposed state of
Nature. Since then it had received the position that the
earth and its fruits were once <i>res nullius</i>, and since its peculiar
view of Nature led it to assume without hesitation that the
human race had actually practised the Occupancy of <i>res
nullius</i> long before the organisation of civil societies, the
inference immediately suggested itself that Occupancy was
the process by which the "no man's goods" of the primitive
world became the private property of individuals in the world
of history. It would be wearisome to enumerate the jurists
who have subscribed to this theory in one shape or another,
and it is the less necessary to attempt it because Blackstone,
who is always a faithful index of the average opinions of
his day, has summed them up in his 2nd book and 1st
chapter.</p>

<p>"The earth," he writes, "and all things therein were the
general property of mankind from the immediate gift of the
Creator. Not that the communion of goods seems ever to
have been applicable, even in the earliest ages, to aught but
the substance of the thing; nor could be extended to the use
of it. For, by the law of nature and reason he who first
began to use it acquired therein a kind of transient property
that lasted so long as he was using it, and no longer; or to
speak with greater precision, the right of possession continued
for the same time only that the act of possession lasted.
Thus the ground was in common, and no part was the permanent
property of any man in particular; yet whoever was
in the occupation of any determined spot of it, for rest, for
shade, or the like, acquired for the time a sort of ownership,
from which it would have been unjust and contrary to the
law of nature to have driven him by force, but the instant
that he quitted the use of occupation of it, another might
seize it without injustice." He then proceeds to argue that
"when mankind increased in number, it became necessary
to entertain conceptions of more permanent dominion, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
to appropriate to individuals not the immediate use only, but
the very substance of the thing to be used."</p>

<p>Some ambiguities of expression in this passage lead to
the suspicion that Blackstone did not quite understand the
meaning of the proposition which he found in his authorities,
that property in the earth's surface was first acquired, under
the law of Nature, by the <i>occupant</i>; but the limitation which
designedly or through misapprehension he has imposed on
the theory brings it into a form which it has not infrequently
assumed. Many writers more famous than Blackstone for
precision of language have laid down that, in the beginning
of things, Occupancy first gave a right against the world to
an exclusive but temporary enjoyment, and that afterwards
this right, while it remained exclusive, became perpetual.
Their object in so stating their theory was to reconcile the
doctrine that in the state of Nature <i>res nullius</i> became
property through Occupancy, with the inference which they
drew from the Scriptural history that the Patriarchs did not
at first permanently appropriate the soil which had been
grazed over by their flocks and herds.</p>

<p>The only criticism which could be directly applied to the
theory of Blackstone would consist in inquiring whether the
circumstances which make up his picture of a primitive
society are more or less probable than other incidents which
could be imagined with equal readiness. Pursuing this
method of examination, we might fairly ask whether the man
who had <i>occupied</i> (Blackstone evidently uses this word with
its ordinary English meaning) a particular spot of ground for
rest or shade would be permitted to retain it without disturbance.
The chances surely are that his right to possession
would be exactly coextensive with his power to keep it, and
that he would be constantly liable to disturbance by the first
comer who coveted the spot and thought himself strong
enough to drive away the possessor. But the truth is that
all such cavil at these positions is perfectly idle from the very
baselessness of the positions themselves. What mankind
did in the primitive state may not be a hopeless subject of
inquiry, but of their motives for doing it it is impossible to
know anything. These sketches of the plight of human
beings in the first ages of the world are effected by first supposing
mankind to be divested of a great part of the circumstances
by which they are now surrounded, and by then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
assuming that, in the condition thus imagined, they would
preserve the same sentiments and prejudices by which they
are now actuated,&mdash;although, in fact, these sentiments may
have been created and engendered by those very circumstances
of which, by the hypothesis, they are to be stripped.</p>

<p>There is an aphorism of Savigny which has been sometimes
thought to countenance a view of the origin of property
somewhat similar to the theories epitomised by Blackstone.
The great German jurist has laid down that all Property is
founded on Adverse Possession ripened by Prescription. It
is only with respect to Roman law that Savigny makes this
statement, and before it can fully be appreciated much labour
must be expended in explaining and defining the expressions
employed. His meaning will, however, be indicated with
sufficient accuracy if we consider him to assert that, how far
soever we carry our inquiry into the ideas of property received
among the Romans, however closely we approach in tracing
them to the infancy of law, we can get no farther than a conception
of ownership involving the three elements in the canon&mdash;Possession,
Adverseness of Possession, that is a holding
not permissive or subordinate, but exclusive against the
world, and Prescription, or a period of time during which the
Adverse Possession has uninterruptedly continued. It is
exceedingly probable that this maxim might be enunciated
with more generality than was allowed to it by its author,
and that no sound or safe conclusion can be looked for from
investigations into any system of laws which are pushed
farther back than the point at which these combined ideas
constitute the notion of proprietary right. Meantime, so
far from bearing out the popular theory of the origin of
property, Savigny's canon is particularly valuable as directing
our attention to its weakest point. In the view of Blackstone
and those whom he follows, it was the mode of assuming
the exclusive enjoyment which mysteriously affected the
minds of the fathers of our race. But the mystery does not
reside here. It is not wonderful that property began in
adverse possession. It is not surprising that the first proprietor
should have been the strong man armed who kept his
goods in peace. But why it was that lapse of time created
a sentiment of respect for his possession&mdash;which is the exact
source of the universal reverence of mankind for that which
has for a long period <i>de facto</i> existed&mdash;are questions really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
deserving the profoundest examination, but lying far beyond
the boundary of our present inquiries.</p>

<p>Before pointing out the quarter in which we may hope to
glean some information, scanty and uncertain at best, concerning
the early history of proprietary right, I venture to
state my opinion that the popular impression in reference to
the part played by Occupancy in the first stages of civilisation
directly reverses the truth. Occupancy is the advised assumption
of physical possession; and the notion that an act of this
description confers a title to "res nullius," so far from being
characteristic of very early societies, is in all probability the
growth of a refined jurisprudence and of a settled condition
of the laws. It is only when the rights of property have
gained a sanction from long practical inviolability and when
the vast majority of the objects of enjoyment have been
subjected to private ownership, that mere possession is
allowed to invest the first possessor with dominion over commodities
in which no prior proprietorship has been asserted.
The sentiment in which this doctrine originated is absolutely
irreconcilable with that infrequency and uncertainty of proprietary
rights which distinguish the beginnings of civilisation.
Its true basis seems to be, not an instinctive bias towards
the institution of Property, but a presumption arising out
of the long continuance of that institution, that <i>everything
ought to have an owner</i>. When possession is taken of a "res
nullius," that is, of an object which <i>is</i> not, or has <i>never</i> been,
reduced to dominion, the possessor is permitted to become
proprietor from a feeling that all valuable things are naturally
the subjects of an exclusive enjoyment, and that in the given
case there is no one to invest with the right of property except
the Occupant. The Occupant in short, becomes the owner,
because all things are presumed to be somebody's property
and because no one can be pointed out as having a better
right than he to the proprietorship of this particular thing.</p>

<p>Even were there no other objection to the descriptions of
mankind in their natural state which we have been discussing,
there is one particular in which they are fatally at variance
with the authentic evidence possessed by us. It will be observed
that the acts and motives which these theories suppose are
the acts and motives of Individuals. It is each Individual
who for himself subscribes the Social Compact. It is some
shifting sandbank in which the grains are Individual men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
that according to the theory of Hobbes is hardened into the
social rock by the wholesome discipline of force. It is an
Individual who, in the picture drawn by Blackstone, "is in
the occupation of a determined spot of ground for rest, for
shade, or the like." The vice is one which necessarily afflicts
all the theories descended from the Natural Law of the
Romans, which differed principally from their Civil Law
in the account which it took of Individuals, and which
has rendered precisely its greatest service to civilisation in
enfranchising the individual from the authority of archaic
society. But Ancient Law, it must again be repeated, knows
next to nothing of Individuals. It is concerned not with
Individuals, but with Families, not with single human beings,
but groups. Even when the law of the State has succeeded
in permeating the small circles of kindred into which it had
originally no means of penetrating, the view it takes of Individuals
is curiously different from that taken by jurisprudence
in its maturest stage. The life of each citizen is not regarded
as limited by birth and death; it is but a continuation of the
existence of his forefathers, and it will be prolonged in the
existence of his descendants.</p>

<p>The Roman distinction between the Law of Persons and
the Law of Things, which though extremely convenient is
entirely artificial, has evidently done much to divert inquiry
on the subject before us from the true direction. The lessons
learned in discussing the Jus Personarum have been forgotten
where the Jus Rerum is reached, and Property, Contract, and
Delict, have been considered as if no hints concerning their
original nature were to be gained from the facts ascertained
respecting the original condition of Persons. The futility
of this method would be manifest if a system of pure archaic
law could be brought before us, and if the experiment could
be tried of applying to it the Roman classifications. It would
soon be seen that the separation of the Law of Persons from
that of Things has no meaning in the infancy of law, that the
rules belonging to the two departments are inextricably
mingled together, and that the distinctions of the later jurists
are appropriate only to the later jurisprudence. From what
has been said in the earlier portions of this treatise, it will be
gathered that there is a strong <i>&agrave; priori</i> improbability of our
obtaining any clue to the early history of property, if we
confine our notice to the proprietary rights of individuals. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
is more than likely that joint-ownership, and not separate
ownership, is the really archaic institution, and that the
forms of property which will afford us instruction will be
those which are associated with the rights of families and of
groups of kindred. The Roman jurisprudence will not here
assist in enlightening us, for it is exactly the Roman jurisprudence
which, transformed by the theory of Natural Law,
has bequeathed to the moderns the impression that individual
ownership is the normal state of proprietary right, and that
ownership in common by groups of men is only the exception
to a general rule. There is, however, one community which
will always be carefully examined by the inquirer who is in
quest of any lost institution of primeval society. How far
soever any such institution may have undergone change
among the branch of the Indo-European family which has
been settled for ages in India, it will seldom be found to have
entirely cast aside the shell in which it was originally reared.
It happens that, among the Hindoos, we do find a form of
ownership which ought at once to rivet our attention from
its exactly fitting in with the ideas which our studies in the
Law of Persons would lead us to entertain respecting the
original condition of property. The Village Community
of India is at once an organised patriarchal society and
an assemblage of co-proprietors. The personal relations to
each other of the men who compose it are indistinguishably
confounded with their proprietary rights, and to the attempts
of English functionaries to separate the two may be assigned
some of the most formidable miscarriages of Anglo-Indian
administration. The Village Community is known to be of
immense antiquity. In whatever direction research has been
pushed into Indian history, general or local, it has always
found the Community in existence at the farthest point of
its progress. A great number of intelligent and observant
writers, most of whom had no theory of any sort to support
concerning its nature and origin, agree in considering it the
least destructible institution of a society which never willingly
surrenders any one of its usages to innovation. Conquests
and revolutions seem to have swept over it without disturbing
or displacing it, and the most beneficent systems of government
in India have always been those which have recognised
it as the basis of administration.</p>

<p>The mature Roman law, and modern jurisprudence follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>ing
in its wake, look upon co-ownership as an exceptional
and momentary condition of the rights of property. This
view is clearly indicated in the maxim which obtains universally
in Western Europe, <i>Nemo in communione potest
invitus detineri</i> ("No one can be kept in co-proprietorship
against his will"). But in India this order of ideas is reversed,
and it may be said that separate proprietorship is
always on its way to become proprietorship in common. The
process has been adverted to already. As soon as a son is
born, he acquires a vested interest in his father's substance,
and on attaining years of discretion he is even, in certain
contingencies, permitted by the letter of the law to call for a
partition of the family estate. As a fact, however, a division
rarely takes place even at the death of the father, and the
property constantly remains undivided for several generations,
though every member of every generation has a legal
right to an undivided share in it. The domain thus held
in common is sometimes administered by an elected manager,
but more generally, and in some provinces always, it is managed
by the eldest agnate, by the eldest representative of
the eldest line of the stock. Such an assemblage of joint
proprietors, a body of kindred holding a domain in common,
is the simplest form of an Indian Village Community, but the
Community is more than a brotherhood of relatives and more
than an association of partners. It is an organised society,
and besides providing for the management of the common
fund, it seldom fails to provide, by a complete staff of functionaries,
for internal government, for police, for the administration
of justice, and for the apportionment of taxes and
public duties.</p>

<p>The process which I have described as that under which
a Village Community is formed, may be regarded as typical.
Yet it is not to be supposed that every Village Community
in India drew together in so simple a manner. Although,
in the North of India, the archives, as I am informed, almost
invariably show that the Community was founded by a single
assemblage of blood-relations, they also supply information
that men of alien extraction have always, from time to time,
been engrafted on it, and a mere purchaser of a share may
generally, under certain conditions, be admitted to the
brotherhood. In the South of the Peninsula there are often
Communities which appear to have sprung not from one but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
from two or more families; and there are some whose composition
is known to be entirely artificial; indeed, the occasional
aggregation of men of different castes in the same society is
fatal to the hypothesis of a common descent. Yet in all
these brotherhoods either the tradition is preserved, or the
assumption made, of an original common parentage. Mountstuart
Elphinstone, who writes more particularly of the
Southern Village Communities, observes of them (<i>History
of India</i>, i. 126): "The popular notion is that the Village
landholders are all descended from one or more individuals
who settled the village; and that the only exceptions are
formed by persons who have derived their rights by purchase
or otherwise from members of the original stock. The
supposition is confirmed by the fact that, to this day, there
are only single families of landholders in small villages and
not many in large ones; but each has branched out into so
many members that it is not uncommon for the whole agricultural
labour to be done by the landholders, without the
aid either of tenants or of labourers. The rights of the
landholders are theirs collectively and, though they almost
always have a more or less perfect partition of them, they
never have an entire separation. A landholder, for instance,
can sell or mortgage his rights; but he must first have the
consent of the Village, and the purchaser steps exactly into
his place and takes up all his obligations. If a family becomes
extinct, its share returns to the common stock."</p>

<p>Some considerations which have been offered in the fifth
chapter of this volume will assist the reader, I trust, in
appreciating the significance of Elphinstone's language. No
institution of the primitive world is likely to have been preserved
to our day, unless it has acquired an elasticity foreign
to its original nature through some vivifying legal fiction.
The Village Community then is not necessarily an assemblage
of blood-relations, but it is <i>either</i> such an assemblage <i>or</i> a
body of co-proprietors formed on the model of an association
of kinsmen. The type with which it should be compared
is evidently not the Roman Family, but the Roman Gens or
House. The Gens was also a group on the model of the
family; it was the family extended by a variety of fictions
of which the exact nature was lost in antiquity. In historical
times, its leading characteristics were the very two which
Elphinstone remarks in the Village Community. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
always the assumption of a common origin, an assumption
sometimes notoriously at variance with fact; and, to repeat
the historian's words, "if a family became extinct, its share
returned to the common stock." In old Roman law, unclaimed
inheritances escheated to the Gentiles. It is further
suspected by all who have examined their history that the
Communities, like the Gentes, have been very generally
adulterated by the admission of strangers, but the exact
mode of absorption cannot now be ascertained. At present,
they are recruited, as Elphinstone tells us, by the admission
of purchasers, with the consent of the brotherhood. The
acquisition of the adopted member is, however, of the nature
of a universal succession; together with the share he has
bought, he succeeds to the liabilities which the vendor had
incurred towards the aggregate group. He is an Emptor
Famili&aelig;, and inherits the legal clothing of the person whose
place he begins to fill. The consent of the whole brotherhood
required for his admission may remind us of the consent
which the Comitia Curiata, the Parliament of that larger
brotherhood of self-styled kinsmen, the ancient Roman
commonwealth, so strenuously insisted on as essential to the
legalisation of an Adoption or the confirmation of a Will.</p>

<p>The tokens of an extreme antiquity are discoverable in
almost every single feature of the Indian Village Communities.
We have so many independent reasons for suspecting that
the infancy of law is distinguished by the prevalence of co-ownership
by the intermixture of personal with proprietary
rights, and by the confusion of public with private duties,
that we should be justified in deducing many important
conclusions from our observation of these proprietary
brotherhoods, even if no similarly compounded societies
could be detected in any other part of the world. It happens,
however, that much earnest curiosity has been very recently
attracted to a similar set of phenomena in those parts of
Europe which have been most slightly affected by the feudal
transformation of property, and which in many important
particulars have as close an affinity with the Eastern as with
the Western world. The researches of M. de Haxthausen,
M. Tengoborski, and others, have shown us that the Russian
villages are not fortuitous assemblages of men, nor are they
unions founded on contract; they are naturally organised
communities like those of India. It is true that these villages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
are always in theory the patrimony of some noble proprietor
and the peasants have within historical times been converted
into the predial, and to a great extent into the personal, serfs
of the seignior. But the pressure of this superior ownership
has never crushed the ancient organisation of the village, and
it is probable that the enactment of the Czar of Russia, who
is supposed to have introduced serfdom, was really intended
to prevent the peasants from abandoning that co-operation
without which the old social order could not long be maintained.
In the assumption of an agnatic connection between
the villagers, in the blending of personal rights with privileges
of ownership, and in a variety of spontaneous provisions for
internal administration, the Russian Village appears to be
a nearly exact repetition of the Indian Community; but there
is one important difference which we note with the greatest
interest. The co-owners of an Indian village, though their
property is blended, have their rights distinct, and this
separation of rights is complete and continues indefinitely.
The severance of rights is also theoretically complete in a
Russian village, but there it is only temporary. After the
expiration of a given, but not in all cases of the same, period
separate ownerships are extinguished, the land of the village
is thrown into a mass, and then it is re-distributed among
the families composing the community, according to their
number. This repartition having been effected, the rights of
families and of individuals are again allowed to branch out
into various lines, which they continue to follow till another
period of division comes round. An even more curious
variation from this type of ownership occurs in some of those
countries which long formed a debateable land between the
Turkish empire and the possessions of the House of Austria.
In Servia, in Croatia, and the Austrian Sclavonia, the villages
are also brotherhoods of persons who are at once co-owners
and kinsmen; but there the internal arrangements of the
community differ from those adverted to in the last two
examples. The substance of the common property is in this
case neither divided in practice nor considered in theory as
divisible, but the entire land is cultivated by the combined
labour of all the villagers, and the produce is annually distributed
among the households, sometimes according to their
supposed wants, sometimes according to rules which give
to particular persons a fixed share of the usufruct. All these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
practices are traced by the jurists of the East of Europe to
a principle which is asserted to be found in the earliest
Sclavonian laws, the principle that the property of families
cannot be divided for a perpetuity.</p>

<p>The great interest of these phenomena in an inquiry like
the present arises from the light they throw on the development
of distinct proprietary rights <i>inside</i> the groups by which
property seems to have been originally held. We have the
strongest reason for thinking that property once belonged
not to individuals nor even to isolated families, but to larger
societies composed on the patriarchal model; but the mode
of transition from ancient to modern ownerships, obscure
at best, would have been infinitely obscurer if several distinguishable
forms of Village Communities had not been discovered
and examined. It is worth while to attend to the
varieties of internal arrangement within the patriarchal
groups which are, or were till recently, observable among
races of Indo-European blood. The chiefs of the ruder
Highland clans used, it is said, to dole out food to the heads
of the households under their jurisdiction at the very shortest
intervals, and sometimes day by day. A periodical distribution
is also made to the Sclavonian villagers of the Austrian
and Turkish provinces by the elders of their body, but then
it is a distribution once for all of the total produce of the year.
In the Russian villages, however, the substance of the property
ceases to be looked upon as indivisible, and separate
proprietary claims are allowed freely to grow up, but then the
progress of separation is peremptorily arrested after it has
continued a certain time. In India, not only is there no
indivisibility of the common fund, but separate proprietorship
in parts of it may be indefinitely prolonged and may
branch out into any number of derivative ownerships, the
<i>de facto</i> partition of the stock being, however, checked by
inveterate usage, and by the rule against the admission of
strangers without the consent of the brotherhood. It is not
of course intended to insist that these different forms of
the Village Community represent distinct stages in a process
of transmutation which has been everywhere accomplished
in the same manner. But, though the evidence does not
warrant our going so far as this, it renders less presumptuous
the conjecture that private property, in the shape in which
we know it, was chiefly formed by the gradual disentanglement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of the separate rights of individuals from the blended
rights of a community. Our studies in the Law of Persons
seemed to show us the Family expanding into the Agnatic
group of kinsmen, then the Agnatic group dissolving into
separate households; lastly the household supplanted by the
individual; and it is now suggested that each step in the
change corresponds to an analogous alteration in the nature
of Ownership. If there be any truth in the suggestion, it is
to be observed that it materially affects the problem which
theorists on the origin of Property have generally proposed
to themselves. The question&mdash;perhaps an insoluble one&mdash;which
they have mostly agitated is, what were the motives
which first induced men to respect each other's possessions?
It may still be put, without much hope of finding an answer to
it, in the form of any inquiry into the reasons which led one
composite group to keep aloof from the domain of another.
But, if it be true that far the most important passage in the
history of Private Property is its gradual elimination from
the co-ownership of kinsmen, then the great point of inquiry
is identical with that which lies on the threshold of all
historical law&mdash;what were the motives which originally
prompted men to hold together in the family union? To
such a question, Jurisprudence, unassisted by other sciences,
is not competent to give a reply. The fact can only be
noted.</p>

<p>The undivided state of property in ancient societies is
consistent with a peculiar sharpness of division, which shows
itself as soon as any single share is completely separated from
the patrimony of the group. This phenomenon springs, doubtless,
from the circumstance that the property is supposed to
become the domain of a new group, so that any dealing with
it, in its divided state, is a transaction between two highly
complex bodies. I have already compared Ancient Law to
Modern International Law, in respect of the size and complexity
of the corporate associations, whose rights and duties
it settles. As the contracts and conveyances known to ancient
law are contracts and conveyances to which not single individuals,
but organised companies of men, are parties, they
are in the highest degree ceremonious; they require a variety
of symbolical acts and words intended to impress the business
on the memory of all who take part in it; and they demand
the presence of an inordinate number of witnesses. From these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
peculiarities, and others allied to them, springs the universally
unmalleable character of the ancient forms of property.
Sometimes the patrimony of the family is absolutely inalienable,
as was the case with the Sclavonians, and still oftener,
though alienations may not be entirely illegitimate, they are
virtually impracticable, as among most of the Germanic
tribes, from the necessity of having the consent of a large
number of persons to the transfer. Where these impediments
do not exist, or can be surmounted, the act of conveyance
itself is generally burdened with a perfect load of ceremony,
in which not one iota can be safely neglected. Ancient law
uniformly refuses to dispense with a single gesture, however
grotesque; with a single syllable, however its meaning may
have been forgotten; with a single witness, however superfluous
may be his testimony. The entire solemnities must be
scrupulously completed by persons legally entitled to take
part in them, or else the conveyance is null, and the seller is
re-established in the rights of which he had vainly attempted
to divest himself.</p>

<p>These various obstacles to the free circulation of the
objects of use and enjoyment, begin of course to make themselves
felt as soon as society has acquired even a slight degree
of activity, and the expedients by which advancing communities
endeavour to overcome them form the staple of the
history of Property. Of such expedients there is one which
takes precedence of the rest from its antiquity and universality.
The idea seems to have spontaneously suggested itself to a
great number of early societies, to classify property into kinds.
One kind or sort of property is placed on a lower footing of
dignity than the others, but at the same time is relieved from
the fetters which antiquity has imposed on them. Subsequently,
the superior convenience of the rules governing the
transfer and descent of the lower order of property becomes
generally recognised, and by a gradual course of innovation
the plasticity of the less dignified class of valuable objects is
communicated to the classes which stand conventionally
higher. The history of Roman Property Law is the history
of the assimilation of Res Mancipi to Res Nec Mancipi. The
history of Property on the European Continent is the history
of the subversion of the feudalised law of land by the
Romanised law of moveables; and, though the history of
ownership in England is not nearly completed, it is visibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the law of personalty which threatens to absorb and annihilate
the law of realty.</p>

<p>The only <i>natural</i> classification of the objects of enjoyment,
the only classification which corresponds with an essential
difference in the subject-matter, is that which divides them
into Moveables and Immoveables. Familiar as is this classification
to jurisprudence, it was very slowly developed by
Roman law, from which we inherit it, and was only finally
adopted by it in its latest stage. The classifications of Ancient
Law have sometimes a superficial resemblance to this. They
occasionally divide property into categories, and place immoveables
in one of them; but then it is found that they
either class along with immoveables a number of objects
which have no sort of relation with them, or else divorce them
from various rights to which they have a close affinity. Thus,
the Res Mancipi of Roman Law included not only land, but
slaves, horses, and oxen. Scottish law ranks with land a
certain class of securities, and Hindoo law associates it with
slaves. English law, on the other hand, parts leases of land
for years from other interests in the soil, and joins them to
personalty under the name of chattels real. Moreover, the
classifications of Ancient Law are classifications implying
superiority and inferiority; while the distinction between
moveables and immoveables, so long at least as it was confined
to Roman jurisprudence, carried with it no suggestion
whatever of a difference in dignity. The Res Mancipi, however,
did certainly at first enjoy a precedence over the Res
Nec Mancipi, as did heritable property in Scotland and realty
in England, over the personalty to which they were opposed.
The lawyers of all systems have spared no pains in striving
to refer these classifications to some intelligible principle; but
the reasons of the severance must ever be vainly sought for
in the philosophy of law: they belong not to its philosophy,
but to its history. The explanation which appears to cover
the greatest number of instances is, that the objects of enjoyment
honoured above the rest were the forms of property
known first and earliest to each particular community, and
dignified therefore emphatically with the designation of
<i>Property</i>. On the other hand, the articles not enumerated
among the favoured objects seem to have been placed on a
lower standing, because the knowledge of their value was
posterior to the epoch at which the catalogue of superior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
property was settled. They were at first unknown, rare,
limited in their uses, or else regarded as mere appendages to
the privileged objects. Thus, though the Roman Res Mancipi
included a number of moveable articles of great value, still
the most costly jewels were never allowed to take rank as
Res Mancipi, because they were unknown to the early Romans.
In the same way chattels real in England are said to have
been degraded to the footing of personalty, from the infrequency
and valuelessness of such estates under the feudal
land-law. But the grand point of interest is, the continued
degradation of these commodities when their importance
had increased and their number had multiplied. Why were
they not successively included among the favoured objects of
enjoyment? One reason is found in the stubbornness with
which Ancient Law adheres to its classifications. It is a characteristic
both of uneducated minds and of early societies,
that they are little able to conceive a general rule apart from
the particular applications of it with which they are practically
familiar. They cannot dissociate a general term or
maxim from the special examples which meet them in daily
experience; and in this way the designation covering the
best-known forms of property is denied to articles which
exactly resemble them in being objects of enjoyment and
subjects of right. But to these influences, which exert peculiar
force in a subject-matter so stable as that of law, are afterwards
added others more consistent with progress in enlightenment
and in the conceptions of general expediency.
Courts and lawyers become at last alive to the inconvenience
of the embarrassing formalities required for the transfer,
recovery, or devolution of the favoured commodities, and
grow unwilling to fetter the newer descriptions of property
with the technical trammels which characterised the infancy
of law. Hence arises a disposition to keep these last on a
lower grade in the arrangements of Jurisprudence, and to
permit their transfer by simpler processes than those which,
in archaic conveyances, serve as stumbling-blocks to good
faith and stepping-stones to fraud. We are perhaps in some
danger of underrating the inconveniences of the ancient
modes of transfer. Our instruments of conveyance are
written, so that their language, well pondered by the professional
draftsman, is rarely defective in accuracy. But an
ancient conveyance was not written, but <i>acted</i>. Gestures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
words took the place of written technical phraseology, and
any formula mispronounced, or symbolical act omitted,
would have vitiated the proceeding as fatally as a material
mistake in stating the uses or setting out the remainders
would, two hundred years ago, have vitiated an English deed.
Indeed, the mischiefs of the archaic ceremonial are even thus
only half stated. So long as elaborate conveyances, written
or acted, are required for the alienation of <i>land</i> alone, the
chances of mistake are not considerable in the transfer of a
description of property which is seldom got rid of with much
precipitation. But the higher class of property in the ancient
world comprised not only land but several of the commonest
and several of the most valuable moveables. When once the
wheels of society had begun to move quickly, there must
have been immense inconvenience in demanding a highly
intricate form of transfer for a horse or an ox, or for the most
costly chattel of the old world&mdash;the Slave. Such commodities
must have been constantly and even ordinarily conveyed
with incomplete forms, and held, therefore, under imperfect
titles.</p>

<p>The Res Mancipi of old Roman law were land&mdash;in historical
times, land on Italian soil,&mdash;slaves and beasts of burden, such
as horses and oxen. It is impossible to doubt that the objects
which make up the class are the instruments of agricultural
labour, the commodities of first consequence to a primitive
people. Such commodities were at first, I imagine, called
emphatically Things or Property, and the mode of conveyance
by which they were transferred was called a Mancipium or
Mancipation; but it was not probably till much later that
they received the distinctive appellation of Res Mancipi,
"Things which require a Mancipation." By their side there
may have existed or grown up a class of objects, for which it
was not worth while to insist upon the full ceremony of
Mancipation. It would be enough if, in transferring these last
from owner to owner, a part only of the ordinary formalities
were proceeded with, namely, that actual delivery, physical
transfer, or <i>tradition</i>, which is the most obvious index of a
change of proprietorship. Such commodities were the Res
Nec Mancipi of the ancient jurisprudence, "things which did
not require a Mancipation," little prized probably at first,
and not often passed from one group of proprietors to another,
While, however, the list of the Res Mancipi was irrevocably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
closed; that of the Res Nec Mancipi admitted of indefinite
expansion; and hence every fresh conquest of man over
material nature added an item to the Res Nec Mancipi,
or effected an improvement in those already recognised.
Insensibly, therefore, they mounted to an equality
with the Res Mancipi, and the impression of an intrinsic
inferiority being thus dissipated, men began to observe the
manifold advantages of the simple formality which accompanied
their transfer over the more intricate and more
venerable ceremonial. Two of the agents of legal amelioration,
Fictions and Equity, were assiduously employed by the
Roman lawyers to give the practical effects of a Mancipation
to a Tradition: and, though Roman legislators long shrank
from enacting that the right of property in a Res Mancipi
should be immediately transferred by bare delivery of the
article, yet even this step was at last ventured upon by
Justinian, in whose jurisprudence the difference between
Res Mancipi and Res Nec Mancipi disappears, and Tradition
or Delivery becomes the one great conveyance known to the
law. The marked preference which the Roman lawyers very
early gave to Tradition caused them to assign it a place in
their theory which has helped to blind their modern disciples
to its true history. It was classed among the "natural"
modes of acquisition, both because it was generally practised
among the Italian tribes, and because it was a process which
attained its object by the simplest mechanism. If the expressions
of the jurisconsults be pressed, they undoubtedly imply
that Tradition, which belongs to the Law Natural, is more
ancient than Mancipation, which is an institution of Civil
Society; and this, I need not say, is the exact reverse of the
truth.</p>

<p>The distinction between Res Mancipi and Res Nec Mancipi
is the type of a class of distinctions to which civilisation is
much indebted, distinctions which run through the whole
mass of commodities, placing a few of them in a class by
themselves, and relegating the others to a lower category.
The inferior kinds of property are first, from disdain and disregard,
released from the perplexed ceremonies in which
primitive law delights, and thus afterwards, in another state
of intellectual progress, the simple methods of transfer and
recovery which have been allowed to come into use serve as a
model which condemns by its convenience and simplicity the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
cumbrous solemnities inherited from ancient days. But, in
some societies, the trammels in which Property is tied up are
much too complicated and stringent to be relaxed in so easy
a manner. Whenever male children have been born to a
Hindoo, the law of India, as I have stated, gives them all an
interest in his property, and makes their consent a necessary
condition of its alienation. In the same spirit, the general
usage of the old Germanic peoples&mdash;it is remarkable that the
Anglo-Saxon customs seem to have been an exception&mdash;forbade
alienations without the consent of the male children;
and the primitive law of the Sclavonians even prohibited
them altogether. It is evident that such impediments as these
cannot be overcome by a distinction between kinds of property,
inasmuch as the difficulty extends to commodities of
all sorts; and accordingly, Ancient Law, when once launched
on a course of improvement, encounters them with a distinction
of another character, a distinction classifying property,
not according to its nature but according to its origin.
In India, where there are traces of both systems of classification,
the one which we are considering is exemplified in the
difference which Hindoo law establishes between Inheritances
and Acquisitions. The inherited property of the father is
shared by the children as soon as they are born; but according
to the custom of most provinces, the acquisitions made
by him during his lifetime are wholly his own, and can be
transferred by him at pleasure. A similar distinction was not
unknown to Roman law, in which the earliest innovation on
the Parental Powers took the form of a permission given to
the son to keep for himself whatever he might have acquired
in military service. But the most extensive use ever made
of this mode of classification appears to have been among the
Germans. I have repeatedly stated that the <i>allod</i>, though not
inalienable, was commonly transferable with the greatest
difficulty; and moreover, it descended exclusively to the
agnatic kindred. Hence an extraordinary variety of distinctions
came to be recognised, all intended to diminish the inconveniences
inseparable from allodial property. The <i>wehrgeld</i>,
for example, or composition for the homicide of a relative,
which occupies so large a space in German jurisprudence,
formed no part of the family domain, and descended according
to rules of succession altogether different. Similarly, the
<i>reipus</i>, or fine leviable on the re-marriage of a widow, did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
enter into the <i>allod</i> of the person to whom it was paid, and
followed a line of devolution in which the privileges of the
agnates were neglected. The law, too, as among the Hindoos,
distinguished the Acquisitions of the chief of the household
from his Inherited property, and permitted him to deal with
them under much more liberal conditions. Classifications of
the other sort were also admitted, and the familiar distinction
drawn between land and moveables; but moveable property
was divided into several subordinate categories, to each of
which different rules applied. This exuberance of classification,
which may strike us as strange in so rude a people as the
German conquerors of the Empire, is doubtless to be explained
by the presence in their systems of a considerable element
of Roman law, absorbed by them during their long sojourn
on the confines of the Roman dominion. It is not difficult to
trace a great number of the rules governing the transfer and
devolution of the commodities which lay outside the <i>allod</i>,
to their source in Roman jurisprudence, from which they were
probably borrowed at widely distant epochs, and in fragmentary
importations. How far the obstacles to the free
circulation of property were surmounted by such contrivances,
we have not the means even of conjecturing, for the distinctions
adverted to have no modern history. As I before explained,
the allodial form of property was entirely lost in the
feudal, and when the consolidation of feudalism was once
completed, there was practically but one distinction left
standing of all those which had been known to the western
world&mdash;the distinction between land and goods, immoveables
and moveables. Externally this distinction was the
same with that which Roman law had finally accepted, but
the law of the middle ages differed from that of Rome in
distinctly considering immoveable property to be more
dignified than moveable. Yet this one sample is enough to
show the importance of the class of expedients to which it
belongs. In all the countries governed by systems based on
the French codes, that is, through much the greatest part of
the Continent of Europe, the law of moveables, which was
always Roman law, has superseded and annulled the feudal
law of land. England is the only country of importance in
which this transmutation, though it has gone some way, is
not nearly accomplished. Our own, too, it may be added, is
the only considerable European country in which the separation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of moveables from immoveables has been somewhat disturbed
by the same influences which caused the ancient
classifications to depart from the only one which is countenanced
by nature. In the main, the English distinction has
been between land and goods; but a certain class of goods
have gone as heir-looms with the land, and a certain description
of interests in land have from historical causes been
ranked with personalty. This is not the only instance in
which English jurisprudence, standing apart from the main
current of legal modification, has reproduced phenomena of
archaic law.</p>

<p>I proceed to notice one or two more contrivances by which
the ancient trammels of proprietary right were more or less
successfully relaxed, premising that the scheme of this treatise
only permits me to mention those which are of great antiquity.
On one of them in particular it is necessary to dwell for
a moment or two, because persons unacquainted with the
early history of law will not be easily persuaded that a principle,
of which modern jurisprudence has very slowly and
with the greatest difficulty obtained the recognition, was
really familiar to the very infancy of legal science. There is
no principle in all law which the moderns, in spite of its beneficial
character, have been so loath to adopt and to carry to its
legitimate consequences as that which was known to the
Romans as Usucapion, and which has descended to modern
jurisprudence under the name of Prescription. It was a positive
rule of the oldest Roman law, a rule older than the Twelve
Tables, that commodities which had been uninterruptedly
possessed for a certain period became the property of the
possessor. The period of possession was exceedingly short&mdash;one
or two years according to the nature of the commodities&mdash;and
in historical times Usucapion was only allowed to operate
when possession had commenced in a particular way; but I
think it likely that at a less advanced epoch possession was
converted into ownership under conditions even less severe
than we read of in our authorities. As I have said before, I
am far from asserting that the respect of men for <i>de facto</i>
possession is a phenomenon which jurisprudence can account
for by itself, but it is very necessary to remark that primitive
societies, in adopting the principle of Usucapion, were not
beset with any of the speculative doubts and hesitations which
have impeded its reception among the moderns. Prescriptions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
were viewed by the modern lawyers, first with repugnance,
afterwards with reluctant approval. In several countries,
including our own, legislation long declined to advance
beyond the rude device of barring all actions based on a
wrong which had been suffered earlier than a fixed point of
time in the past, generally the first year of some preceding
reign; nor was it till the middle ages had finally closed, and
James the First had ascended the throne of England, that we
obtained a true statute of limitation of a very imperfect
kind. This tardiness in copying one of the most famous
chapters of Roman law, which was no doubt constantly read
by the majority of European lawyers, the modern world owes
to the influence of the Canon Law. The ecclesiastical customs
out of which the Canon Law grew, concerned as they were
with sacred or quasi-sacred interests, very naturally regarded
the privileges which they conferred as incapable of being lost
through disuse however prolonged; and in accordance with
this view, the spiritual jurisprudence, when afterwards consolidated,
was distinguished by a marked leaning against
Prescriptions. It was the fate of the Canon Law, when held
up by the clerical lawyers as a pattern to secular legislation,
to have a peculiar influence on first principles. It gave to the
bodies of custom which were formed throughout Europe far
fewer express rules than did the Roman law, but then it
seems to have communicated a bias to professional opinion on
a surprising number of fundamental points, and the tendencies
thus produced progressively gained strength as each system
was developed. One of the dispositions it produced was a
disrelish for Prescriptions; but I do not know that this prejudice
would have operated as powerfully as it has done, if it
had not fallen in with the doctrine of the scholastic jurists of
the realist sect, who taught that, whatever turn actual legislation
might take, a <i>right</i>, how long soever neglected, was in
point of fact indestructible. The remains of this state of
feeling still exist. Wherever the philosophy of law is earnestly
discussed, questions respecting the speculative basis of Prescription
are always hotly disputed; and it is still a point of
the greatest interest in France and Germany, whether a person
who has been out of possession for a series of years is deprived
of his ownership as a penalty for his neglect, or loses it
through the summary interposition of the law in its desire to
have a <i>finis litium</i>. But no such scruples troubled the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of early Roman society. Their ancient usages directly took
away the ownership of everybody who had been out of possession,
under certain circumstances, during one or two years.
What was the exact tenor of the rule of Usucapion in its
earliest shape, it is not easy to say; but, taken with the limitations
which we find attending it in the books, it was a most
useful security against the mischiefs of a too cumbrous
system of conveyance. In order to have the benefit of
Usucapion, it was necessary that the adverse possession
should have begun in good faith, that is, with belief on the
part of the possessor that he was lawfully acquiring the property,
and it was farther required that the commodity should
have been transferred to him by some mode of alienation
which, however unequal to conferring a complete title in the
particular case, was at least recognised by the law. In the
case therefore of a Mancipation, however slovenly the performance
might have been, yet if it had been carried so far
as to involve a Tradition or Delivery, the vice of the title
would be cured by Usucapion in two years at most. I know
nothing in the practice of the Romans which testifies so
strongly to their legal genius as the use which they made of
Usucapion. The difficulties which beset them were nearly the
same with those which embarrassed and still embarrass the
lawyers of England. Owing to the complexity of their system,
which as yet they had neither the courage nor the power to
reconstruct, actual right was constantly getting divorced
from technical right, the equitable ownership from the legal.
But Usucapion, as manipulated by the jurisconsults, supplied
a self-acting machinery, by which the defects of titles to
property were always in course of being cured, and by which
the ownerships that were temporarily separated were again
rapidly cemented together with the briefest possible delay.
Usucapion did not lose its advantages till the reforms of
Justinian. But as soon as law and equity had been completely
fused, and when Mancipation ceased to be the
Roman conveyance, there was no further necessity for
the ancient contrivance, and Usucapion, with its periods
of time considerably lengthened, became the Prescription
which has at length been adopted by nearly all systems of
modern law.</p>

<p>I pass by with brief mention another expedient having the
same object with the last, which, though it did not imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>diately
make its appearance in English legal history, was of
immemorial antiquity in Roman law; such indeed is its
apparent age that some German civilians, not sufficiently
aware of the light thrown on the subject by the analogies of
English law, have thought it even older than the Mancipation.
I speak of the Cessio in Jure, a collusive recovery, in a Court
of law, of property sought to be conveyed. The plaintiff
claimed the subject of this proceeding with the ordinary forms
of a litigation; the defendant made default; and the commodity
was of course adjudged to the plaintiff. I need scarcely
remind the English lawyer that this expedient suggested itself
to our forefathers, and produced those famous Fines and
Recoveries which did so much to undo the harshest trammels
of the feudal land-law. The Roman and English contrivances
have very much in common and illustrate each other most instructively,
but there is this difference between them, that the
object of the English lawyers was to remove complications
already introduced into the title, while the Roman jurisconsults
sought to prevent them by substituting a mode of
transfer necessarily unimpeachable for one which too often
miscarried. The device is, in fact, one which suggests itself
as soon as Courts of Law are in steady operation, but are
nevertheless still under the empire of primitive notions. In
an advanced state of legal opinion, tribunals regard collusive
litigation as an abuse of their procedure; but there has
always been a time when, if their forms were scrupulously
complied with, they never dreamed of looking further.</p>

<p>The influence of Courts of Law and of their procedure upon
Property has been most extensive, but the subject is too
large for the dimensions of this treatise, and would carry us
further down the course of legal history than is consistent
with its scheme. It is desirable, however, to mention, that
to this influence we must attribute the importance of the distinction
between Property and Possession&mdash;not, indeed, the
distinction itself, which (in the language of an eminent
English civilian) is the same thing as the distinction between
the legal right to act upon a thing and the physical power to
do so&mdash;but the extraordinary importance which the distinction
has obtained in the philosophy of law. Few educated
persons are so little versed in legal literature as not to have
heard that the language of the Roman jurisconsults on the
subject of Possession long occasioned the greatest possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
perplexity, and that the genius of Savigny is supposed to have
chiefly proved itself by the solution which he discovered for
the enigma. Possession, in fact, when employed by the Roman
lawyers, appears to have contracted a shade of meaning not
easily accounted for. The word, as appears from its etymology,
must have originally denoted physical contact or
physical contact resumeable at pleasure; but, as actually used
without any qualifying epithet, it signifies not simply physical
detention, but physical detention coupled with the intention
to hold the thing detained as one's own. Savigny, following
Niebuhr, perceived that for this anomaly there could only
be a historical origin. He pointed out that the Patrician
burghers of Rome, who had become tenants of the greatest
part of the public domain at nominal rents, were, in the
view of the old Roman law, mere possessors, but then
they were possessors intending to keep their land against all
comers. They, in truth, put forward a claim almost identical
with that which has recently been advanced in England by
the lessees of Church lands. Admitting that in theory they
were the tenants-at-will of the state, they contended that
time and undisturbed enjoyment had ripened their holding
into a species of ownership, and that it would be unjust to
eject them for the purpose of redistributing the domain. The
association of this claim with the Patrician tenancies, permanently
influenced the sense of "possession." Meanwhile
the only legal remedies of which the tenants could avail themselves,
if ejected or threatened with disturbance, were the
Possessory Interdicts, summary processes of Roman law
which were either expressly devised by the Pr&aelig;tor for their
protection, or else, according to another theory, had in older
times been employed for the provisional maintenance of possessions
pending the settlement of questions of legal right.
It came, therefore, to be understood that everybody who
possessed property <i>as his own</i> had the power of demanding the
Interdicts, and, by a system of highly artificial pleading, the
Interdictal process was moulded into a shape fitted for the
trial of conflicting claims to a disputed possession. Then
commenced a movement which, as Mr. John Austin pointed
out, exactly reproduced itself in English law. Proprietors,
<i>domini</i>, began to prefer the simpler forms or speedier course
of the Interdict to the lagging and intricate formalities of
the Real Action, and for the purpose of availing themselves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the possessory remedy fell back upon the possession which was
supposed to be involved in their proprietorship. The liberty
conceded to persons who were not true Possessors, but Owners,
to vindicate their rights by possessory remedies, though it
may have been at first a boon, had ultimately the effect of
seriously deteriorating both English and Roman jurisprudence.
The Roman law owes to it those subtleties on the subject
of Possession which have done so much to discredit it,
while English law, after the actions which it appropriated to
the recovery of real property had fallen into the most hopeless
confusion, got rid at last of the whole tangled mass by a
heroic remedy. No one can doubt that the virtual abolition
of the English real actions which took place nearly thirty
years since was a public benefit, but still persons sensitive to
the harmonies of jurisprudence will lament that, instead of
cleansing, improving, and simplifying the true proprietary
actions, we sacrificed them all to the possessory action of
ejectment, thus basing our whole system of land recovery
upon a legal fiction.</p>

<p>Legal tribunals have also powerfully assisted to shape and
modify conceptions of proprietary right by means of the distinction
between Law and Equity, which always makes its
first appearance as a distinction between jurisdictions. Equitable
property in England is simply property held under the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. At Rome, the Pr&aelig;tor's
Edict introduced its novel principles in the guise of a promise
that under certain circumstances a particular action or a
particular plea would be granted; and, accordingly, the
property <i>in bonis</i>, or Equitable Property, of Roman law was
property exclusively protected by remedies which had their
source in the Edict. The mechanism by which equitable
rights were saved from being overridden by the claims of the
legal owner was somewhat different in the two systems. With
us their independence is secured by the Injunction of the
Court of Chancery. Since however Law and Equity, while not
as yet consolidated, were administered under the Roman
system by the same Court, nothing like the Injunction was
required, and the Magistrate took the simpler course of refusing
to grant to the Civil Law Owner those actions and
pleas by which alone he could obtain the property that
belonged in equity to another. But the practical operation
of both systems was nearly the same. Both, by means of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
distinction in procedure, were able to preserve new forms of
property in a sort of provisional existence, until the time
should come when they were recognised by the whole law.
In this way, the Roman Pr&aelig;tor gave an immediate right of
property to the person who had acquired a Res Mancipi by
mere delivery, without waiting for the ripening of Usucapion.
Similarly he in time recognised an ownership in the Mortgagee
who had at first been a mere "bailee" or depositary,
and in the Emphyteuta, or tenant of land which was subject
to a fixed perpetual rent. Following a parallel line of progress,
the English Court of Chancery created a special proprietorship
for the Mortgagor, for the Cestui que Trust, for the
Married Woman who had the advantage of a particular kind
of settlement, and for the Purchaser who had not yet acquired
a complete legal ownership. All these are examples in which
forms of proprietory right, distinctly new, were recognised
and preserved. But indirectly Property has been affected in
a thousand ways by equity both in England and at Rome.
Into whatever corner of jurisprudence its authors pushed the
powerful instrument in their command, they were sure to
meet, and touch, and more or less materially modify the law
of property. When in the preceding pages I have spoken of
certain ancient legal distinctions and expedients as having
powerfully affected the history of ownership, I must be understood
to mean that the greatest part of their influence has
arisen from the hints and suggestions of improvement infused
by them into the mental atmosphere which was breathed by
the fabricators of equitable systems.</p>

<p>But to describe the influence of Equity on Ownership would
be to write its history down to our own days. I have alluded
to it principally because several esteemed contemporary
writers have thought that in the Roman severance of Equitable
from Legal property we have the clue to that difference
in the conception of Ownership, which apparently distinguishes
the law of the middle ages from the law of the Roman
Empire. The leading characteristic of the feudal conception
is its recognition of a double proprietorship, the superior
ownership of the lord of the fief co-existing with the inferior
property or estate of the tenant. Now, this duplication of
proprietary right looks, it is urged, extremely like a generalised
form of the Roman distribution of rights over property into
<i>Quiritarian</i> or legal, and (to use a word of late origin) <i>Bonitarian</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
or equitable. Gaius himself observes upon the splitting of <i>dominion</i> into two parts as a singularity of Roman law,
and expressly contrasts it with the entire or allodial ownership
to which other nations were accustomed. Justinian, it
is true, re-consolidated dominion into one, but then it was
the partially reformed system of the Western Empire, and
not Justinian's jurisprudence, with which the barbarians were
in contact during so many centuries. While they remained
poised on the edge of the Empire, it may well be that they
learned this distinction, which afterwards bore remarkable
fruit. In favour of this theory, it must at all events be
admitted that the element of Roman law in the various
bodies of barbarian custom has been very imperfectly
examined. The erroneous or insufficient theories which have
served to explain Feudalism resemble each other in their
tendency to draw off attention from this particular ingredient
in its texture. The older investigators, who have been mostly
followed in this country, attached an exclusive importance
to the circumstances of the turbulent period during which the
Feudal system grew to maturity; and in later times a new
source of error has been added to those already existing, in
that pride of nationality which has led German writers to
exaggerate the completeness of the social fabric which their
forefathers had built up before their appearance in the Roman
world. One or two English inquirers who looked in the right
quarter for the foundations of the feudal system, failed nevertheless
to conduct their investigations to any satisfactory
result, either from searching too exclusively for analogies in
the compilations of Justinian, or from confining their attention
to the compendia of Roman law which are found
appended to some of the extant barbarian codes. But, if
Roman jurisprudence had any influence on the barbarous
societies, it had probably produced the greatest part of its
effects before the legislation of Justinian, and before the
preparation of these compendia. It was not the reformed
and purified jurisprudence of Justinian, but the undigested
system which prevailed in the Western Empire, and which the
Eastern <i>Corpus Juris</i> never succeeded in displacing, that I
conceive to have clothed with flesh and muscle the scanty
skeleton of barbarous usage. The change must be supposed
to have taken place before the Germanic tribes had distinctly
appropriated, as conquerors, any portion of the Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
dominions, and therefore long before Germanic monarchs had
ordered breviaries of Roman law to be drawn up for the use
of their Roman subjects. The necessity for some such
hypothesis will be felt by everybody who can appreciate the
difference between archaic and developed law. Rude as are
the <i>Leges Barbarorum</i> which remain to us, they are not rude
enough to satisfy the theory of their purely barbarous origin;
nor have we any reason for believing that we have received,
in written records, more than a fraction of the fixed rules
which were practised among themselves by the members of
the conquering tribes. If we can once persuade ourselves that
a considerable element of debased Roman law already existed
in the barbarian systems, we shall have done something to
remove a grave difficulty. The German law of the conquerors
and the Roman law of their subjects would not have combined
if they had not possessed more affinity for each other than
refined jurisprudence has usually for the customs of savages.
It is extremely likely that the codes of the barbarians,
archaic as they seem, are only a compound of true primitive
usage with half-understood Roman rules, and that it was the
foreign ingredient which enabled them to coalesce with a
Roman jurisprudence that had already receded somewhat
from the comparative finish which it had acquired under the
Western Emperors.</p>

<p>But, though all this must be allowed, there are several
considerations which render it unlikely that the feudal form
of ownership was directly suggested by the Roman duplication
of domainial rights. The distinction between legal and
equitable property strikes one as a subtlety little likely to be
appreciated by barbarians; and, moreover, it can scarcely
be understood unless Courts of Law are contemplated in
regular operation. But the strongest reason against this
theory is the existence in Roman Law of a form of property&mdash;a
creation of Equity, it is true&mdash;which supplies a much simpler
explanation of the transition from one set of ideas to the
other. This is the Emphyteusis, upon which the Fief of the
middle ages has often been fathered, though without much
knowledge of the exact share which it had in bringing feudal
ownership into the world. The truth is that the Emphyteusis,
not probably as yet known by its Greek designation,
marks one stage in a current of ideas which led ultimately to
feudalism. The first mention in Roman history of estates larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
than could be farmed by a Paterfamilias, with his household
of sons and slaves, occurs when we come to the holdings of
the Roman patricians. These great proprietors appear to
have had no idea of any system of farming by free tenants.
Their <i>latifundia</i> seem to have been universally cultivated by
slave-gangs, under bailiffs who were themselves slaves or
freedmen; and the only organisation attempted appears to
have consisted in dividing the inferior slaves into small bodies,
and making them the <i>peculium</i> of the better and trustier sort,
who thus acquired a kind of interest in the efficiency of their
labour. This system was, however, especially disadvantageous
to one class of estated proprietors, the Municipalities.
Functionaries in Italy were changed with the rapidity which
often surprises us in the administration of Rome herself; so
that the superintendence of a large landed domain by an
Italian corporation must have been excessively imperfect.
Accordingly, we are told that with the municipalities began
the practice of letting out <i>agri vectigules</i>, that is, of leasing
land for a perpetuity to a free tenant, at a fixed rent, and
under certain conditions. The plan was afterwards extensively
imitated by individual proprietors, and the tenant,
whose relation to the owner had originally been determined
by his contract, was subsequently recognised by the Pr&aelig;tor
as having himself a qualified proprietorship, which in time
became known as an Emphyteusis. From this point the
history of tenure parts into two branches. In the course of
that long period during which our records of the Roman
Empire are most incomplete, the slave-gangs of the great
Roman families became transformed into the <i>coloni</i>, whose
origin and situation constitute one of the obscurest questions
in all history. We may suspect that they were formed partly
by the elevation of the slaves, and partly by the degradation
of the free farmers; and that they prove the richer classes of
the Roman Empire to have become aware of the increased
value which landed property obtains when the cultivator
had an interest in the produce of the land. We know that
their servitude was predial; that it wanted many of the
characteristics of absolute slavery, and that they acquitted
their service to the landlord in rendering to him a fixed
portion of the annual crop. We know further that they
survived all the mutations of society in the ancient and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>modern worlds. Though included in the lower courses of the
feudal structure, they continued in many countries to render
to the landlord precisely the same dues which they had paid
to the Roman <i>dominus</i>, and from a particular class among
them, the <i>coloni medietarii</i> who reserved half the produce for
the owner, are descended the <i>metayer</i> tenantry, who still
conduct the cultivation of the soil in almost all the South of
Europe. On the other hand, the Emphyteusis, if we may so
interpret the allusions to it in the <i>Corpus Juris</i>, became a
favourite and beneficial modification of property; and it may
be conjectured that wherever free farmers existed, it was
this tenure which regulated their interest in the land. The
Pr&aelig;tor, as has been said, treated the Emphyteuta as a true
proprietor. When ejected, he was allowed to reinstate himself
by a Real Action, the distinctive badge of proprietory
right, and he was protected from disturbance by the author
of his lease so long as the <i>canon</i>, or quit-rent, was punctually
paid. But at the same time it must not be supposed that the
ownership of the author of the lease was either extinct or
dormant. It was kept alive by a power of re-entry on nonpayment
of the rent, a right of pre-emption in case of sale,
and a certain control over the mode of cultivation. We have,
therefore, in the Emphyteusis a striking example of the
double ownership which characterised feudal property, and
one, moreover, which is much simpler and much more easily
imitated than the juxtaposition of legal and equitable rights.
The history of the Roman tenure does not end, however, at
this point. We have clear evidence that between the great
fortresses which, disposed along the line of the Rhine and
Danube, long secured the frontier of the Empire against its
barbarian neighbours, there extended a succession of strips
of land, the <i>agri limitrophi</i>, which were occupied by veteran
soldiers of the Roman army on the terms of an Emphyteusis.
There was a double ownership. The Roman State was landlord
of the soil, but the soldiers cultivated it without disturbance
so long as they held themselves ready to be called out
for military service whenever the state of the border should
require it. In fact, a sort of garrison-duty, under a system
closely resembling that of the military colonies on the Austro-Turkish
border, had taken the place of the quit-rent which
was the service of the ordinary Emphyteuta. It seems impossible
to doubt that this was the precedent copied by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>barbarian monarchs who founded feudalism. It had been
within their view for some hundred years, and many of the
veterans who guarded the border were, it is to be remembered,
themselves of barbarian extraction, who probably spoke the
Germanic tongues. Not only does the proximity of so easily
followed a model explain whence the Frankish and Lombard
Sovereigns got the idea of securing the military service of
their followers by granting away portions of their public
domain; but it perhaps explains the tendency which immediately
showed itself in the Benefices to become hereditary,
for an Emphyteusis, though capable of being moulded to the
terms of the original contract, nevertheless descended as a
general rule to the heirs of the grantee. It is true that the
holder of a benefice, and more recently the lord of one of those
fiefs into which the benefices were transformed, appears to
have owed certain services which were not likely to have
been rendered by the military colonist, and were certainly
not rendered by the Emphyteuta. The duty of respect and
gratitude to the feudal superior, the obligation to assist in
endowing his daughter and equipping his son, the liability to
his guardianship in minority, and many other similar incidents
of tenure, must have been literally borrowed from
the relations of Patron and Freedman under Roman law,
that is, of quondam-master and quondam-slave. But then
it is known that the earliest beneficiaries were the personal
companions of the sovereign, and it is indisputable that this
position, brilliant as it seems, was at first attended by some
shade of servile debasement. The person who ministered to
the Sovereign in his Court had given up something of that
absolute personal freedom which was the proudest privilege
of the allodial proprietor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the early history of contract</span></h4>


<p>There are few general propositions concerning the age to
which we belong which seem at first sight likely to be received
with readier concurrence than the assertion that the society
of our day is mainly distinguished from that of preceding
generations by the largeness of the sphere which is occupied
in it by Contract. Some of the phenomena on which this
proposition rests are among those most frequently singled
out for notice, for comment, and for eulogy. Not many of
us are so unobservant as not to perceive that in innumerable
cases where old law fixed a man's social position irreversibly
at his birth, modern law allows him to create it for himself
by convention; and indeed several of the few exceptions
which remain to this rule are constantly denounced with
passionate indignation. The point, for instance, which is really
debated in the vigorous controversy still carried on upon the
subject of negro servitude, is whether the status of the slave
does not belong to bygone institutions, and whether the only
relation between employer and labourer which commends
itself to modern morality be not a relation determined exclusively
by contract. The recognition of this difference between
past ages and the present enters into the very essence of the
most famous contemporary speculations. It is certain that
the science of Political Economy, the only department of
moral inquiry which has made any considerable progress in
our day, would fail to correspond with the facts of life if it
were not true that Imperative Law had abandoned the largest
part of the field which it once occupied, and had left men to
settle rules of conduct for themselves with a liberty never
allowed to them till recently. The bias indeed of most persons
trained in political economy is to consider the general truth
on which their science reposes as entitled to become universal,
and, when they apply it as an art, their efforts are
ordinarily directed to enlarging the province of Contract and
to curtailing that of Imperative Law, except so far as law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
is necessary to enforce the performance of Contracts. The
impulse given by thinkers who are under the influence of these
ideas is beginning to be very strongly felt in the Western
world. Legislation has nearly confessed its inability to keep
pace with the activity of man in discovery, in invention, and
in the manipulation of accumulated wealth; and the law
even of the least advanced communities tends more and more
to become a mere surface-stratum having under it an ever-changing
assemblage of contractual rules with which it rarely
interferes except to compel compliance with a few fundamental
principles or unless it be called in to punish the
violation of good faith.</p>

<p>Social inquiries, so far as they depend on the consideration
of legal phenomena, are in so backward a condition that we
need not be surprised at not finding these truths recognised
in the commonplaces which pass current concerning the
progress of society. These commonplaces answer much more
to our prejudices than to our convictions. The strong disinclination
of most men to regard morality as advancing seems
to be especially powerful when the virtues on which Contract
depends are in question, and many of us have almost instinctive
reluctance to admitting that good faith and trust in our
fellows are more widely diffused than of old, or that there
is anything in contemporary manners which parallels the
loyalty of the antique world. From time to time, these prepossessions
are greatly strengthened by the spectacle of
frauds, unheard of before the period at which they were
observed, and astonishing from their complication as well
as shocking from criminality. But the very character of these
frauds shows clearly that, before they became possible, the
moral obligations of which they are the breach must have been
more than proportionately developed. It is the confidence
reposed and deserved by the many which affords facilities
for the bad faith of the few, so that, if colossal examples of
dishonesty occur, there is no surer conclusion than that
scrupulous honesty is displayed in the average of the transactions
which, in the particular case, have supplied the
delinquent with his opportunity. If we insist on reading the
history of morality as reflected in jurisprudence, by turning
our eyes not on the law of Contract but on the law of Crime,
we must be careful that we read it aright. The only form of
dishonesty treated of in the most ancient Roman law is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Theft. At the moment at which I write, the newest chapter
in the English criminal law is one which attempts to prescribe
punishment for the frauds of Trustees. The proper inference
from this contrast is not that the primitive Romans practised
a higher morality than ourselves. We should rather say that,
in the interval between their days and ours, morality has
advanced from a very rude to a highly refined conception&mdash;from
viewing the rights of property as exclusively sacred, to
looking upon the rights growing out of the mere unilateral
reposal of confidence as entitled to the protection of the
penal law.</p>

<p>The definite theories of jurists are scarcely nearer the truth
in this point than the opinions of the multitude. To begin
with the views of the Roman lawyers, we find them inconsistent
with the true history of moral and legal progress. One
class of contracts, in which the plighted faith of the contracting
parties was the only material ingredient, they
specifically denominated Contracts <i>juris gentium</i>, and though
these contracts were undoubtedly the latest born into the
Roman system, the expression employed implies, if a definite
meaning be extracted from it, that they were more ancient
than certain other forms of engagement treated of in Roman
law, in which the neglect of a mere technical formality was as
fatal to the obligation as misunderstanding or deceit. But
then the antiquity to which they were referred was vague,
shadowy, and only capable of being understood through the
Present; nor was it until the language of the Roman lawyers
became the language of an age which had lost the key to their
mode of thought that a "Contract of the Law of Nations"
came to be distinctly looked upon as a Contract known to
man in a State of Nature. Rousseau adopted both the juridical
and the popular error. In the Dissertation on the effects
of Art and Science upon Morals, the first of his works which
attracted attention and the one in which he states most
unreservedly the opinions which made him the founder of a
sect, the veracity and good faith attributed to the ancient
Persians are repeatedly pointed out as traits of primitive
innocence which have been gradually obliterated by civilisation;
and at a later period he found a basis for all his speculations
in the doctrine of an original Social Contract. The
Social Contract or Compact is the most systematic form
which has ever been assumed by the error we are discussing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
It is a theory which, though nursed into importance by political
passions, derived all its sap from the speculations of
lawyers. True it certainly is that the famous Englishmen, for
whom it had first had attraction, valued it chiefly for its
political serviceableness, but, as I shall presently attempt
to explain, they would never have arrived at it, if politicians
had not long conducted their controversies in legal phraseology.
Nor were the English authors of the theory blind to
that speculative amplitude which recommended it so strongly
to the Frenchmen who inherited it from them. Their writings
show they perceived that it could be made to account for all
social, quite as well as for all political phenomena. They
had observed the fact, already striking in their day, that of
the positive rules obeyed by men, the greater part were
created by Contract, the lesser by Imperative Law. But
they were ignorant or careless of the historical relation of
these two constituents of jurisprudence. It was for the purpose,
therefore, of gratifying their speculative tastes by
attributing all jurisprudence to a uniform source, as much
as with the view of eluding the doctrines which claimed a
divine parentage for Imperative Law, that they devised the
theory that all Law had its origin in Contract. In another
stage of thought, they would have been satisfied to leave
their theory in the condition of an ingenious hypothesis or
a convenient verbal formula. But that age was under the
dominion of legal superstitions. The State of Nature had been
talked about till it had ceased to be regarded as paradoxical,
and hence it seemed easy to give a fallacious reality and
definiteness to the contractual origin of Law by insisting on
the Social Compact as a historical fact.</p>

<p>Our own generation has got rid of these erroneous juridical
theories, partly by outgrowing the intellectual state to which
they belong, and partly by almost ceasing to theorise on such
subjects altogether. The favourite occupation of active minds
at the present moment, and the one which answers to the
speculations of our forefathers on the origin of the social state,
is the analysis of society as it exists and moves before our
eyes; but, through omitting to call in the assistance of history,
this analysis too often degenerates into an idle exercise
of curiosity, and is especially apt to incapacitate the inquirer
for comprehending states of society which differ considerably
from that to which he is accustomed. The mistake of judging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the men of other periods by the morality of our own day has
its parallel in the mistake of supposing that every wheel
and bolt in the modern social machine had its counterpart
in more rudimentary societies. Such impressions ramify very
widely, and masque themselves very subtly, in historical
works written in the modern fashion; but I find the trace
of their presence in the domain of jurisprudence in the praise
which is frequently bestowed on the little apologue of Montesquieu
concerning the Troglodytes, inserted in the <i>Lettres
Persanes</i>. The Troglodytes were a people who systematically
violated their Contracts, and so perished utterly. If the story
bears the moral which its author intended, and is employed to
expose an anti-social heresy by which this century and the
last have been threatened, it is most unexceptionable; but
if the inference be obtained from it that society could not
possibly hold together without attaching a sacredness to
promises and agreements which should be on something like
a par with the respect that is paid to them by a mature civilisation,
it involves an error so grave as to be fatal to all sound
understanding of legal history. The fact is that the Troglodytes
have flourished and founded powerful states with very
small attention to the obligations of Contract. The point
which before all others has to be apprehended in the constitution
of primitive societies is that the individual creates for
himself few or no rights, and few or no duties. The rules which
he obeys are derived first from the station into which he is
born, and next from the imperative commands addressed to
him by the chief of the household of which he forms part.
Such a system leaves the very smallest room for Contract.
The members of the same family (for so we may interpret
the evidence) are wholly incapable of contracting with each
other, and the family is entitled to disregard the engagements
by which any one of its subordinate members has attempted
to bind it. Family, it is true, may contract with family,
chieftain with chieftain, but the transaction is one of the same
nature, and encumbered by as many formalities, as the
alienation of property, and the disregard of one iota of the
performance is fatal to the obligation. The positive duty
resulting from one man's reliance on the word of another is
among the slowest conquests of advancing civilisation.</p>

<p>Neither Ancient Law nor any other source of evidence
discloses to us society entirely destitute of the conception of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Contract. But the conception, when it first shows itself, is
obviously rudimentary. No trustworthy primitive record
can be read without perceiving that the habit of mind which
induces us to make good a promise is as yet imperfectly
developed, and that acts of flagrant perfidy are often mentioned
without blame and sometimes described with approbation.
In the Homeric literature, for instance, the deceitful
cunning of Ulysses appears as a virtue of the same rank with
the prudence of Nestor, the constancy of Hector, and the
gallantry of Achilles. Ancient law is still more suggestive
of the distance which separates the crude form of Contract
from its maturity. At first, nothing is seen like the interposition
of law to compel the performance of a promise.
That which the law arms with its sanctions is not a promise,
but a promise accompanied with a solemn ceremonial. Not
only are formalities of equal importance with the promise
itself, but they are, if anything, of greater importance; for
that delicate analysis which mature jurisprudence applies
to the conditions of mind under which a particular verbal
assent is given appears, in ancient law, to be transferred to
the words and gestures of the accompanying performance.
No pledge is enforced if a single form be omitted or misplaced,
but, on the other hand, if the forms can be shown
to have been accurately proceeded with, it is of no avail
to plead that the promise was made under duress or deception.
The transmutation of this ancient view into the
familiar notion of a Contract is plainly seen in the history of
jurisprudence. First one or two steps in the ceremonial are
dispensed with; then the others are simplified or permitted
to be neglected on certain conditions; lastly, a few specific
contracts are separated from the rest and allowed to be
entered into without form, the selected contracts being those
on which the activity and energy of social intercourse depends.
Slowly, but most distinctly, the mental engagement isolates
itself amid the technicalities, and gradually becomes the sole
ingredient on which the interest of the jurisconsult is concentrated.
Such a mental engagement, signified through external
acts, the Romans called a Pact or Convention; and
when the Convention has once been conceived as the nucleus
of a Contract, it soon becomes the tendency of advancing
jurisprudence to break away the external shell of form and
ceremony. Forms are thenceforward only retained so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
as they are guarantees of authenticity, and securities for
caution and deliberation. The idea of a Contract is fully
developed, or, to employ the Roman phrase, Contracts are
absorbed in Pacts.</p>

<p>The history of this course of change in Roman law is
exceedingly instructive. At the earliest dawn of the jurisprudence,
the term in use for a Contract was one which is
very familiar to the students of historical Latinity. It was
<i>nexum</i>, and the parties to the contract were said to be <i>nexi</i>,
expressions which must be carefully attended to on account
of the singular durableness of the metaphor on which they
are founded. The notion that persons under a contractual
engagement are connected together by a strong <i>bond</i> or
<i>chain</i>, continued till the last to influence the Roman jurisprudence
of Contract; and flowing thence it has mixed
itself with modern ideas. What then was involved in this
nexum or bond? A definition which has descended to us
from one of the Latin antiquarians describes <i>nexum</i> as <i>omne
quod geritur per &aelig;s et libram</i>, "every transaction with the
copper and the balance," and these words have occasioned
a good deal of perplexity. The copper and the balance are
the well-known accompaniments of the Mancipation, the
ancient solemnity described in a former chapter, by which
the right of ownership in the highest form of Roman Property
was transferred from one person to another. Mancipation
was a <i>conveyance</i>, and hence has arisen the difficulty, for the
definition thus cited appears to confound Contracts and Conveyances,
which in the philosophy of jurisprudence are not
simply kept apart, but are actually opposed to each other.
The <i>jus in re</i>, right <i>in rem</i>, right "availing against all the
world," or Proprietary Right, is sharply distinguished by the
analyst of mature jurisprudence from the <i>jus ad rem</i>, right
<i>in personam</i>, right "availing a single individual or group,"
or obligation. Now Conveyances transfer Proprietary Rights,
Contracts create Obligations&mdash;how then can the two be included
under the same name or same general conception?
This, like many similar embarrassments, has been occasioned
by the error of ascribing to the mental condition of an unformed
society a faculty which pre-eminently belongs to an
advanced stage of intellectual development, the faculty of
distinguishing in speculation ideas which are blended in
practice. We have indications not to be mistaken of a state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
of social affairs in which Conveyances and Contracts were
practically confounded; nor did the discrepance of the
conceptions become perceptible till men had begun to adopt
a distinct practice in contracting and conveying.</p>

<p>It may here be observed that we know enough of ancient
Roman law to give some idea of the mode of transformation
followed by legal conceptions and by legal phraseology in the
infancy of Jurisprudence. The change which they undergo
appears to be a change from general to special; or, as we
might otherwise express it, the ancient conceptions and
the ancient terms are subjected to a process of gradual
specialisation. An ancient legal conception corresponds
not to one but to several modern conceptions. An ancient
technical expression serves to indicate a variety of things
which in modern law have separate names allotted to
them. If however we take up the history of Jurisprudence
at the next stage, we find that the subordinate conceptions
have gradually disengaged themselves and that the old
general names are giving way to special appellations. The
old general conception is not obliterated, but it has ceased
to cover more than one or a few of the notions which it first
included. So too the old technical name remains, but it discharges
only one of the functions which it once performed.
We may exemplify this phenomenon in various ways. Patriarchal
Power of all sorts appears, for instance, to have been
once conceived as identical in character, and it was doubtless
distinguished by one name. The Power exercised by the
ancestor was the same whether it was exercised over the
family or the material property&mdash;over flocks, herds, slaves,
children, or wife. We cannot be absolutely certain of its old
Roman name, but there is very strong reason for believing,
from the number of expressions indicating shades of the notion
of <i>power</i> into which the word <i>manus</i> enters, that the ancient
general term was <i>manus</i>. But, when Roman law has advanced
a little, both the name and the idea have become
specialised. Power is discriminated, both in word and in
conception, according to the object over which it is exerted.
Exercised over material commodities or slaves, it has become
<i>dominium</i>&mdash;over children, it is <i>Potestas</i>&mdash;over free persons
whose services have been made away to another by their
own ancestor, it is <i>mancipium</i>&mdash;over a wife, it is still <i>manus</i>.
The old word, it will be perceived, has not altogether fallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
into desuetude, but is confined to one very special exercise
of the authority it had formerly denoted. This example will
enable us to comprehend the nature of the historical alliance
between Contracts and Conveyances. There seems to have
been one solemn ceremonial at first for all solemn transactions,
and its name at Rome appears to have been <i>nexum</i>.
Precisely the same forms which were in use when a conveyance
of property was effected seem to have been employed
in the making of a contract. But we have not very far to
move onwards before we come to a period at which the
notion of a Contract has disengaged itself from the notion of
a Conveyance. A double change has thus taken place. The
transaction "with the copper and the balance," when intended
to have for its office the transfer of property, is known
by the new and special name of Mancipation. The ancient
Nexum still designates the same ceremony, but only when
it is employed for the special purpose of solemnising a
contract.</p>

<p>When two or three legal conceptions are spoken of as
anciently blended in one, it is not intended to imply that
some one of the included notions may not be older than the
others, or, when those others have been formed, may not
greatly predominate over and take precedence over them.
The reason why one legal conception continues so long to
cover several conceptions, and one technical phrase to do
instead of several, is doubtless that practical changes are
accomplished in the law of primitive societies long before
men see occasion to notice or name them. Though I have
said that Patriarchal Power was not at first distinguished
according to the objects over which it was exercised, I feel
sure that Power over Children was the root of the old conception
of Power; and I cannot doubt that the earliest use
of the Nexum, and the one primarily regarded by those who
resorted to it, was to give proper solemnity to the alienation
of property. It is likely that a very slight perversion of the
Nexum from its original functions first gave rise to its employment
in Contracts, and that the very slightness of the
change long prevented its being appreciated or noticed. The
old name remained because men had not become conscious
that they wanted a new one; the old notion clung to the
mind because nobody had seen reason to be at the pains
of examining it. We have had the process clearly exemplified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
in the history of Testaments. A Will was at first a simple
conveyance of property. It was only the enormous practical
difference that gradually showed itself between this particular
conveyance and all others which caused it to be regarded
separately, and even as it was, centuries elapsed before the
ameliorators of law cleared away the useless encumbrance of
the nominal mancipation, and consented to care for nothing
in the Will but the expressed intentions of the Testator. It is
unfortunate that we cannot track the early history of Contracts
with the same absolute confidence as the early history
of Wills, but we are not quite without hints that contracts
first showed themselves through the <i>nexum</i> being put to a
new use and afterwards obtained recognition as distinct
transactions through the important practical consequences of
the experiment. There is some, but not very violent, conjecture
in the following delineation of the process. Let us
conceive a sale for ready money as the normal type of the
Nexum. The seller brought the property of which he intended
to dispose&mdash;a slave, for example&mdash;the purchaser attended
with the rough ingots of copper which served for money&mdash;and
an indispensable assistant, the <i>libripens</i>, presented himself
with a pair of scales. The slave with certain fixed formalities
was handed over to the vendee&mdash;the copper was weighed
by the <i>libripens</i> and passed to the vendor. So long as the
business lasted it was a <i>nexum</i>, and the parties were <i>nexi</i>; but
the moment it was completed, the <i>nexum</i> ended, and the
vendor and purchaser ceased to bear the name derived from
their momentary relation. But now, let us move a step onward
in commercial history. Suppose the slave transferred,
but the money not paid. In <i>that</i> case, the <i>nexum</i> is finished,
so far as the seller is concerned, and when he has once handed
over his property, he is no longer <i>nexus</i>; but, in regard to
the purchaser, the <i>nexum</i> continues. The transaction, as to
his part of it, is incomplete, and he is still considered to be
<i>nexus</i>. It follows, therefore, that the same term described
the Conveyance by which the right of property was transmitted,
and the personal obligation of the debtor for the unpaid
purchase-money. We may still go forward, and picture
to ourselves a proceeding wholly formal, in which <i>nothing</i>
is handed over and <i>nothing</i> paid; we are brought at once to
a transaction indicative of much higher commercial activity,
an <i>executory Contract of Sale</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>If it be true that, both in the popular and in the professional
view, a <i>Contract</i> was long regarded as an <i>incomplete
Conveyance</i>, the truth has importance for many reasons. The
speculations of the last century concerning mankind in a
state of nature, are not unfairly summed up in the doctrine
that "in the primitive society property was nothing, and
obligation everything;" and it will now be seen that, if
the proposition were reversed, it would be nearer the reality.
On the other hand, considered historically, the primitive
association of Conveyances and Contracts explains something
which often strikes the scholar and jurist as singularly
enigmatical, I mean the extraordinary and uniform severity
of very ancient systems of law to <i>debtors</i>, and the extravagant
powers which they lodge with <i>creditors</i>. When once we
understand that the <i>nexum</i> was artificially prolonged to give
time to the debtor, we can better comprehend his position
in the eye of the public and of the law. His indebtedness was
doubtless regarded as an anomaly, and suspense of payment
in general as an artifice and a distortion of strict rule. The
person who had duly consummated his part in the transaction
must, on the contrary, have stood in peculiar favour; and
nothing would seem more natural than to arm him with
stringent facilities for enforcing the completion of a proceeding
which, of strict right, ought never to have been
extended or deferred.</p>

<p>Nexum, therefore, which originally signified a Conveyance of
property, came insensibly to denote a Contract also, and ultimately
so constant became the association between this word
and the notion of a Contract, that a special term, Mancipium
or Mancipatio, had to be used for the purpose of designating
the true nexum or transaction in which the property was
really transferred. Contracts are therefore now severed from
Conveyances, and the first stage in their history is accomplished,
but still they are far enough from that epoch of their
development when the promise of the contractor has a
higher sacredness than the formalities with which it is coupled.
In attempting to indicate the character of the changes passed
through in this interval, it is necessary to trespass a little
on a subject which lies properly beyond the range of these
pages, the analysis of Agreement effected by the Roman
jurisconsults. Of this analysis, the most beautiful monument
of their sagacity, I need not say more than that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
based on the theoretical separation of the Obligation from
the Convention or Pact. Bentham and Mr. Austin have laid
down that the "two main essentials of a contract are these:
first, a signification by the promising party of his <i>intention</i>
to do the acts or to observe the forbearances which he promises
to do or to observe. Secondly, a signification by the
promisee that he <i>expects</i> the promising party will fulfil the
proffered promise." This is virtually identical with the doctrine
of the Roman lawyers, but then, in their view, the
result of these "significations" was not a Contract, but a
Convention or Pact. A Pact was the utmost product of the
engagements of individuals agreeing among themselves, and
it distinctly fell short of a Contract. Whether it ultimately
became a Contract depended on the question whether the
law annexed an Obligation to it. A Contract was a Pact (or
Convention) <i>plus</i> an Obligation. So long as the Pact remained
unclothed with the Obligation, it was called <i>nude</i>
or <i>naked</i>.</p>

<p>What was an Obligation? It is defined by the Roman
lawyers as "Juris vinculum, quo necessitate adstringimur
alicujus solvend&aelig; rei." This definition connects the Obligation
with the Nexum through the common metaphor on
which they are founded, and shows us with much clearness
the pedigree of a peculiar conception. The Obligation is the
"bond" or "chain" with which the law joins together persons
or groups of persons, in consequence of certain voluntary
acts. The acts which have the effect of attracting an Obligation
are chiefly those classed under the heads of Contract and
Delict, of Agreement and Wrong; but a variety of other
acts have a similar consequence which are not capable of
being comprised in an exact classification. It is to be remarked,
however, that the act does not draw to itself the Obligation
in consequence of any moral necessity; it is the law which
annexes it in the plenitude of its power, a point the more
necessary to be noted, because a different doctrine has
sometimes been propounded by modern interpreters of the
Civil Law who had moral or metaphysical theories of their
own to support. The image of a <i>vinculum juris</i> colours and
pervades every part of the Roman law of Contract and Delict.
The law bound the parties together, and the <i>chain</i> could only
be undone by the process called <i>solutio</i>, an expression still
figurative, to which our word "payment" is only occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and incidentally equivalent. The consistency with which
the figurative image was allowed to present itself, explains
an otherwise puzzling peculiarity of Roman legal phraseology,
the fact that "Obligation" signified rights as well as duties,
the right, for example, to have a debt paid as well as the duty
of paying it. The Romans kept in fact the entire picture of the
"legal chain" before their eyes, and regarded one end of it no
more and no less than the other.</p>

<p>In the developed Roman law, the Convention, as soon as
it was completed, was, in almost all cases, at once crowned
with the Obligation, and so became a Contract; and this
was the result to which contract-law was surely tending. But
for the purpose of this inquiry, we must attend particularly
to the intermediate stage&mdash;that in which something more
than a perfect agreement was required to attract the Obligation.
This epoch is synchronous with the period at which
the famous Roman classification of Contracts into four sorts&mdash;the
Verbal, the Literal, the Real, and the Consensual&mdash;had
come into use, and during which these four orders of
Contracts constituted the only descriptions of engagement
which the law would enforce. The meaning of the fourfold
distribution is readily understood as soon as we apprehend
the theory which severed the Obligation from the Convention.
Each class of contracts was in fact named from certain
formalities which were required over and above the mere
agreement of the contracting parties. In the Verbal Contract,
as soon as the Convention was effected, a form of words had
to be gone through before the vinculum juris was attached
to it. In the Literal Contract, an entry in a ledger or table-book
had the effect of clothing the Convention with the
Obligation, and the same result followed, in the case of the
Real Contract, from the delivery of the Res or Thing which was
the subject of the preliminary engagement. The contracting
parties came, in short, to an understanding in each case; but,
if they went no further, they were not <i>obliged</i> to one another,
and could not compel performance or ask redress for a breach
of faith. But let them comply with certain prescribed formalities,
and the Contract was immediately complete, taking
its name from the particular form which it had suited them
to adopt. The exceptions to this practice will be noticed
presently.</p>

<p>I have enumerated the four Contracts in their historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
order, which order, however, the Roman Institutional writers
did not invariably follow. There can be no doubt that the
Verbal Contract was the most ancient of the four, and that
it is the eldest known descendant of the primitive Nexum.
Several species of Verbal Contract were anciently in use,
but the most important of all, and the only one treated of by
our authorities, was effected by means of a <i>stipulation</i>, that is,
a Question and Answer; a question addressed by the person
who exacted the promise, and an answer given by the person
who made it. This question and answer constituted the
additional ingredient which, as I have just explained, was
demanded by the primitive notion over and above the mere
agreement of the persons interested. They formed the agency
by which the Obligation was annexed. The old Nexum has
now bequeathed to maturer jurisprudence first of all the
conception of a chain uniting the contracting parties, and
this has become the Obligation. It has further transmitted
the notion of a ceremonial accompanying and consecrating
the engagement, and this ceremonial has been transmuted
into the Stipulation. The conversion of the solemn conveyance,
which was the prominent feature of the original Nexum,
into a mere question and answer, would be more of a mystery
than it is if we had not the analogous history of Roman
Testaments to enlighten us. Looking to that history, we can
understand how the formal Conveyance was first separated
from the part of the proceeding which had immediate reference
to the business in hand, and how afterwards it was
omitted altogether. As then the question and answer of the
Stipulation were unquestionably the Nexum in a simplified
shape, we are prepared to find that they long partook of the
nature of a technical form. It would be a mistake to consider
them as exclusively recommending themselves to the older
Roman lawyers through their usefulness in furnishing persons
meditating an agreement with an opportunity for consideration
and reflection. It is not to be disputed that they had a
value of this kind, which was gradually recognised; but there
is proof that their function in respect to Contracts was at
first formal and ceremonial in the statement of our authorities,
that not every question and answer was of old sufficient to
constitute a Stipulation, but only a question and answer
couched in technical phraseology specially appropriated to
the particular occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>But although it is essential for the proper appreciation of
the history of contract-law that the Stipulation should be
understood to have been looked upon as a solemn form before
it was recognised as a useful security, it would be wrong on
the other hand to shut our eyes to its real usefulness. The
Verbal Contract, though it had lost much of its ancient
importance, survived to the latest period of Roman jurisprudence;
and we may take it for granted that no institution
of Roman law had so extended a longevity unless it served
some practical advantage. I observe in an English writer
some expressions of surprise that the Romans even of the
earliest times were content with so meagre a protection
against haste and irreflection. But on examining the Stipulation
closely, and remembering that we have to do with a
state of society in which written evidence was not easily
procurable, I think we must admit that this Question and
Answer, had it been expressly devised to answer the purpose
which it served, would have been justly designated a highly
ingenious expedient. It was the <i>promisee</i> who, in the character
of stipulator, put all the terms of the contract into the
form of a question, and the answer was given by the <i>promisor</i>.
"Do you promise that you will deliver me such and
such a slave, at such and such a place, on such and such a
day?" "I do promise." Now, if we reflect for a moment, we
shall see that this obligation to put the promise interrogatively
inverts the natural position of the parties, and, by
effectually breaking the tenor of the conversation, prevents
the attention from gliding over a dangerous pledge. With us,
a verbal promise is, generally speaking, to be gathered exclusively
from the words of the promisor. In old Roman law,
another step was absolutely required; it was necessary for
the promisee, after the agreement had been made, to sum
up all its terms in a solemn interrogation; and it was of this
interrogation, of course, and of the assent to it, that proof
had to be given at the trial&mdash;<i>not</i> of the promise, which was not
in itself binding. How great a difference this seemingly
insignificant peculiarity may make in the phraseology of
contract-law is speedily realised by the beginner in Roman
jurisprudence, one of whose first stumbling-blocks is almost
universally created by it. When we in English have occasion,
in mentioning a contract, to connect it for convenience'
sake with one of the parties&mdash;for example, if we wished to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
speak generally of a contractor&mdash;it is always the promis<i>or</i>
at whom our words are pointing. But the general language
of Roman law takes a different turn; it always regards the
contract, if we may so speak, from the point of view of the
promis<i>ee</i>; in speaking of a party to a contract, it is always
the Stipulator, the person who asks the question, who is
primarily alluded to. But the serviceableness of the stipulation
is most vividly illustrated by referring to the actual
examples in the pages of the Latin comic dramatists. If the
entire scenes are read down in which these passages occur
(ex. gra. Plautus, <i>Pseudolus</i>, Act I. sc. i; Act IV. sc. 6; <i>Trinummus</i>,
Act V. sc. 2), it will be perceived how effectually the
attention of the person meditating the promise must have
been arrested by the question, and how ample was the opportunity
for withdrawal from an improvident undertaking.</p>

<p>In the Literal or Written Contract, the formal act, by
which an Obligation was superinduced on the Convention,
was an entry of the sum due, where it could be specifically
ascertained, on the debit side of a ledger. The explanation
of this Contract turns on a point of Roman domestic manners,
the systematic character and exceeding regularity of bookkeeping
in ancient times. There are several minor difficulties
of old Roman law, as, for example, the nature of the Slave's
Peculium, which are only cleared up when we recollect that
a Roman household consisted of a number of persons strictly
accountable to its head, and that every single item of domestic
receipt and expenditure, after being entered in waste books,
was transferred at stated periods to a general household ledger.
There are some obscurities, however, in the descriptions we
have received of the Literal Contract, the fact being that the
habit of keeping books ceased to be universal in later times,
and the expression "Literal Contract" came to signify a
form of engagement entirely different from that originally
understood. We are not, therefore, in a position to say, with
respect to the primitive Literal Contract, whether the obligation
was created by a simple entry on the part of the creditor,
or whether the consent of the debtor or a corresponding entry
in his own books was necessary to give it legal effect. The
essential point is however established that, in the case of this
Contract, all formalities were dispensed with on a condition
being complied with. This is another step downwards in the
history of contract-law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>The Contract which stands next in historical succession,
the Real Contract, shows a great advance in ethical conceptions.
Whenever any agreement had for its object the delivery
of a specific thing&mdash;and this is the case with the large majority
of simple engagements&mdash;the Obligation was drawn down as
soon as the delivery had actually taken place. Such a result
must have involved a serious innovation on the oldest ideas
of Contract; for doubtless, in the primitive times, when a
contracting party had neglected to clothe his agreement in a
stipulation, nothing done in pursuance of the agreement
would be recognised by the law. A person who had paid
over money on loan would be unable to sue for its repayment
unless he had formally <i>stipulated</i> for it. But, in the Real
Contract, performance on one side is allowed to impose a
legal duty on the other&mdash;evidently on ethical grounds. For
the first time then moral considerations appear as an ingredient
in Contract-law, and the Real Contract differs from its
two predecessors in being founded on these, rather than on
respect for technical forms or on deference to Roman domestic
habits.</p>

<p>We now reach the fourth class, or Consensual Contracts,
the most interesting and important of all. Four specified
Contracts were distinguished by this name: Mandatum, <i>i.e.</i>
Commission or Agency; Societas or Partnership; Emtio
Venditio or Sale; and Locatio Conductio or Letting and
Hiring. A few pages ago, after stating that a Contract consisted
of a Pact or Convention to which an Obligation had
been superadded, I spoke of certain acts or formalities by
which the law permitted the Obligation to be attracted to the
Pact. I used this language on account of the advantage of a
general expression, but it is not strictly correct unless it be
understood to include the negative as well as the positive.
For, in truth, the peculiarity of these Consensual Contracts
is that <i>no</i> formalities, are required to create them out of the
Pact. Much that is indefensible, and much more that is
obscure, has been written about the Consensual Contracts, and
it has even been asserted that in them the <i>consent</i> of the
Parties is more emphatically given than in any other species
of agreement. But the term Consensual merely indicates that
the Obligation is here annexed at once to the <i>Consensus</i>. The
Consensus, or mutual assent of the parties, is the final and
crowning ingredient in the Convention, and it is the special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
characteristic of agreements falling under one of the four
heads of Sale, Partnership, Agency, and Hiring, that, as
soon as the assent of the parties has supplied this ingredient,
there is <i>at once</i> a Contract. The Consensus draws with it the
Obligation, performing, in transactions of the sort specified,
the exact functions which are discharged, in the other contracts,
by the <i>Res</i> or Thing, by the <i>Verba</i> stipulationis, and
by the <i>Liter&aelig;</i> or written entry in a ledger. Consensual is
therefore a term which does not involve the slightest anomaly,
but is exactly analogous to Real, Verbal, and Literal.</p>

<p>In the intercourse of life the commonest and most important
of all the contracts are unquestionably the four styled
Consensual. The larger part of the collective existence of
every community is consumed in transactions of buying and
selling, of letting and hiring, of alliances between men for
purposes of business, of delegation of business from one man
to another; and this is no doubt the consideration which led
the Romans, as it has led most societies, to relieve these
transactions from technical incumbrance, to abstain as much
as possible from clogging the most efficient springs of social
movement. Such motives were not of course confined to
Rome, and the commerce of the Romans with their neighbours
must have given them abundant opportunities for
observing that the contracts before us tended everywhere to
become <i>Consensual</i>, obligatory on the mere signification of
mutual assent. Hence, following their usual practice, they
distinguished these contracts as contracts <i>Juris Gentium</i>.
Yet I do not think that they were so named at a very early
period. The first notions of a Jus Gentium may have been
deposited in the minds of the Roman lawyers long before the
appointment of a Pr&aelig;tor Peregrinus, but it would only be
through extensive and regular trade that they would be
familiarised with the contractual system of other Italian
communities, and such a trade would scarcely attain considerable
proportions before Italy had been thoroughly
pacified, and the supremacy of Rome conclusively assured.
Although, however, there is strong probability that the
Consensual Contracts were the latest-born into the Roman
system, and though it is likely that the qualification, <i>Juris
Gentium</i>, stamps the recency of their origin, yet this very
expression, which attributes them to the "Law of Nations,"
has in modern times produced the notion of their extreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
antiquity. For, when the "Law of Nations" had been converted
into the "Law of Nature," it seemed to be implied
that the Consensual Contracts were the type of the agreements
most congenial to the natural state; and hence arose the
singular belief that the younger the civilisation, the simpler
must be its forms of contract.</p>

<p>The Consensual Contracts, it will be observed, were extremely
limited in number. But it cannot be doubted that
they constituted the stage in the history of Contract-law from
which all modern conceptions of contract took their start.
The motion of the will which constitutes agreement was now
completely insulated, and became the subject of separate
contemplation; forms were entirely eliminated from the
notion of contract, and external acts were only regarded as
symbols of the internal act of volition. The Consensual
Contracts had, moreover, been classed in the Jus Gentium,
and it was not long before this classification drew with it
the inference that they were the species of agreement which
represented the engagements approved of by Nature and
included in her code. This point once reached, we are prepared
for several celebrated doctrines and distinctions of the
Roman lawyers. One of them is the distinction between
Natural and Civil Obligations. When a person of full intellectual
maturity had deliberately bound himself by an
engagement, he was said to be under a <i>natural obligation</i>,
even though he had omitted some necessary formality, and
even though through some technical impediment he was
devoid of the formal capacity for making a valid contract.
The law (and this is what the distinction implies) would
not enforce the obligation, but it did not absolutely refuse to
recognise it; and <i>natural obligations</i> differed in many respects
from obligations which were merely null and void, more
particularly in the circumstance that they could be civilly
confirmed, if the capacity for contract were subsequently
acquired. Another very peculiar doctrine of the jurisconsults
could not have had its origin earlier than the period at which
the Convention was severed from the technical ingredients of
Contract. They taught that though nothing but a Contract
could be the foundation of an <i>action</i>, a mere Pact or Convention
could be the basis of a <i>plea</i>. It followed from this, that
though nobody could sue upon an agreement which he had
not taken the precaution to mature into a Contract by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
complying with the proper forms, nevertheless a claim arising
out of a valid contract could be rebutted by proving a counter-agreement
which had never got beyond the state of a simple
convention. An action for the recovery of a debt could be
met by showing a mere informal agreement to waive or
postpone the payment.</p>

<p>The doctrine just stated indicates the hesitation of the
Pr&aelig;tors in making their advances towards the greatest of
their innovations. Their theory of Natural law must have
led them to look with especial favour on the Consensual
Contracts and on those Pacts or Conventions of which the
Consensual Contracts were only particular instances; but
they did not at once venture on extending to all Conventions
the liberty of the Consensual Contracts. They took advantage
of that special superintendence over procedure which had
been confided to them since the first beginnings of Roman
law, and, while they still declined to permit a suit to be
launched which was not based on a formal contract, they gave
full play to their new theory of agreement in directing the
ulterior stages of the proceeding. But, when they had proceeded
thus far, it was inevitable that they should proceed
farther. The revolution of the ancient law of Contract was
consummated when the Pr&aelig;tor of some one year announced
in his Edict that he would grant equitable actions upon Pacts
which had never been matured at all into Contracts, provided
only that the Pacts in question had been founded on a consideration
(<i>causa</i>). Pacts of this sort are always enforced under
the advanced Roman jurisprudence. The principle is merely
the principle of the Consensual Contract carried to its proper
consequence; and, in fact, if the technical language of the
Romans had been as plastic as their legal theories, these
Pacts enforced by the Pr&aelig;tor would have been styled new
Contracts, new Consensual Contracts. Legal phraseology
is, however, the part of the law which is the last to alter, and
the Pacts equitably enforced continued to be designated
simply Pr&aelig;torian Pacts. It will be remarked that unless there
were consideration for the Pact, it would continue <i>nude</i> so
far as the new jurisprudence was concerned; in order to give
it effect, it would be necessary to convert it by a stipulation
into a Verbal Contract.</p>

<p>The extreme importance of this history of Contract, as a
safeguard against almost innumerable delusions, must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
my justification for discussing it at so considerable a length.
It gives a complete account of the march of ideas from one
great landmark of jurisprudence to another. We begin with
Nexum, in which a Contract and a Conveyance are blended,
and in which the formalities which accompany the agreement
are even more important than the agreement itself. From
the Nexum we pass to the Stipulation, which is a simplified
form of the older ceremonial. The Literal Contract comes
next, and here all formalities are waived, if proof of the
agreement can be supplied from the rigid observances of a
Roman household. In the Real Contract a moral duty is for
the first time recognised, and persons who have joined or
acquiesced in the partial performance of an engagement are
forbidden to repudiate it on account of defects in form.
Lastly, the Consensual Contracts emerge, in which the mental
attitude of the contractors is solely regarded, and external
circumstances have no title to notice except as evidence of
the inward undertaking. It is of course uncertain how far
this progress of Roman ideas from a gross to a refined conception
exemplifies the necessary progress of human thought
on the subject of Contract. The Contract-law of all other
ancient societies but the Roman is either too scanty to furnish
information, or else is entirely lost; and modern jurisprudence
is so thoroughly leavened with the Roman notions
that it furnishes us with no contrasts or parallels from which
instruction can be gleaned. From the absence, however,
of everything violent, marvellous, or unintelligible in the
changes I have described, it may be reasonably believed that
the history of ancient Roman Contracts is, up to a certain
point, typical of the history of this class of legal conceptions
in other ancient societies. But it is only up to a certain point
that the progress of Roman law can be taken to represent the
progress of other systems of jurisprudence. The theory of
Natural law is exclusively Roman. The notion of the <i>vinculum
juris</i>, so far as my knowledge extends, is exclusively
Roman. The many peculiarities of the mature Roman law
of Contract and Delict which are traceable to these two ideas,
whether singly or in combination, are therefore among the
exclusive products of one particular society. These later
legal conceptions are important, not because they typify
the necessary results of advancing thought under all conditions,
but because they have exercised perfectly enormous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
influence on the intellectual diathesis of the modern
world.</p>

<p>I know nothing more wonderful than the variety of
sciences to which Roman law, Roman Contract-law more
particularly, has contributed modes of thought, courses of
reasoning, and a technical language. Of the subjects which
have whetted the intellectual appetite of the moderns, there
is scarcely one, except Physics, which has not been filtered
through Roman jurisprudence. The science of pure Metaphysics
had, indeed, rather a Greek than a Roman parentage,
but Politics, Moral Philosophy, and even Theology, found
in Roman law not only a vehicle of expression, but a nidus in
which some of their profoundest inquiries were nourished
into maturity. For the purpose of accounting for this phenomenon,
it is not absolutely necessary to discuss the mysterious
relation between words and ideas, or to explain how it is that
the human mind has never grappled with any subject of
thought, unless it has been provided beforehand with a proper
store of language and with an apparatus of appropriate logical
methods. It is enough to remark, that, when the philosophical
interests of the Eastern and Western worlds were separated,
the founders of Western thought belonged to a society which
spoke Latin and reflected in Latin. But in the Western
provinces the only language which retained sufficient precision
for philosophical purposes was the language of Roman
law, which by a singular fortune had preserved nearly all
the purity of the Augustan age, while vernacular Latin was
degenerating into a dialect of portentous barbarism. And if
Roman jurisprudence supplied the only means of exactness
in speech, still more emphatically did it furnish the only
means of exactness, subtlety, or depth in thought. For at
least three centuries, philosophy and science were without
a home in the West; and though metaphysics and metaphysical
theology were engrossing the mental energies of
multitudes of Roman subjects, the phraseology employed
in these ardent inquiries was exclusively Greek, and their
theatre was the Eastern half of the Empire. Sometimes,
indeed, the conclusions of the Eastern disputants became
so important that every man's assent to them, or dissent
from them, had to be recorded, and then the West was introduced
to the results of Eastern controversy, which it generally
acquiesced in without interest and without resistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Meanwhile, one department of inquiry, difficult enough for
the most laborious, deep enough for the most subtle, delicate
enough for the most refined, had never lost its attractions for
the educated classes of the Western provinces. To the cultivated
citizen of Africa, of Spain, of Gaul and of Northern
Italy, it was jurisprudence, and jurisprudence only, which
stood in the place of poetry and history, of philosophy and
science. So far then from there being anything mysterious
in the palpably legal complexion of the earliest efforts of
Western thought it would rather be astonishing if it had
assumed any other hue. I can only express my surprise at
the scantiness of the attention which has been given to the
difference between Western ideas and Eastern, between
Western theology and Eastern, caused by the presence of a
new ingredient. It is precisely because the influence of
jurisprudence begins to be powerful that the foundation of
Constantinople and the subsequent separation of the Western
Empire from the Eastern, are epochs in philosophical history.
But continental thinkers are doubtless less capable of appreciating
the importance of this crisis by the very intimacy with
which notions derived from Roman Law are mingled up
with every-day ideas. Englishmen, on the other hand, are
blind to it through the monstrous ignorance to which they
condemn themselves of the most plentiful source of the
stream of modern knowledge, of the one intellectual result
of the Roman civilisation. At the same time, an Englishman,
who will be at the pains to familiarise himself with the
classical Roman law, is perhaps, from the very slightness of
the interest which his countrymen have hitherto taken in the
subject, a better judge than a Frenchman or a German of the
value of the assertions I have ventured to make. Anybody
who knows what Roman jurisprudence is, as actually practised
by the Romans, and who will observe in what characteristics
the earliest Western theology and philosophy differ
from the phases of thought which preceded them, may be
safely left to pronounce what was the new element which
had begun to pervade and govern speculation.</p>

<p>The part of Roman law which has had most extensive
influence on foreign subjects of inquiry has been the law of
Obligation, or what comes nearly to the same thing, of Contract
and Delict. The Romans themselves were not unaware
of the offices which the copious and malleable terminology<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
belonging to this part of their system might be made to
discharge, and this is proved by their employment of the
peculiar adjunct <i>quasi</i> in such expressions as Quasi-Contract
and Quasi-Delict. "Quasi," so used, is exclusively a term
of classification. It has been usual with English critics to
identify the Quasi-contracts with <i>implied</i> contracts, but this
is an error, for implied contracts are true contracts, which
quasi-contracts are not. In implied contracts, acts and
circumstances are the symbols of the same ingredients which
are symbolised, in express contracts, by words; and whether
a man employs one set of symbols or the other must be a
matter of indifference so far as concerns the theory of agreement.
But a Quasi-Contract is not a contract at all. The
commonest sample of the class is the relation subsisting
between two persons one of whom has paid money to the
other through mistake. The law, consulting the interests
of morality, imposes an obligation on the receiver to refund,
but the very nature of the transaction indicates that it is not
a contract, inasmuch as the Convention, the most essential
ingredient of Contract, is wanting. This word "quasi,"
prefixed to a term of Roman law, implies that the conception
to which it serves as an index is connected with the conception
with which the comparison is instituted by a strong
superficial analogy or resemblance. It does not denote that
the two conceptions are the same or that they belong to the
same genus. On the contrary, it negatives the notion of an
identity between them; but it points out that they are
sufficiently similar for one to be classed as the sequel to the
other, and that the phraseology taken from one department
of law may be transferred to the other and employed without
violent straining in the statement of rules which would otherwise
be imperfectly expressed.</p>

<p>It has been shrewdly remarked, that the confusion between
Implied Contracts, which are true contracts, and Quasi
Contracts, which are not contracts at all, has much in common
with the famous error which attributed political rights and
duties to an Original Compact between the governed and
the governor. Long before this theory had clothed itself in
definite shape, the phraseology of Roman contract-law had
been largely drawn upon to describe that reciprocity of rights
and duties which men had always conceived as existing between
sovereigns and subjects. While the world was full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
maxims setting forth with the utmost positiveness the claims
of kings to implicit obedience&mdash;maxims which pretended to
have had their origin in the New Testament, but which were
really derived from indelible recollections of the C&aelig;sarian
despotism&mdash;the consciousness of correlative rights possessed
by the governed would have been entirely without the means
of expression if the Roman law of Obligation had not supplied
a language capable of shadowing forth an idea which was as
yet imperfectly developed. The antagonism between the
privileges of kings and their duties to their subjects was
never, I believe, lost sight of since Western history began,
but it had interest for few except speculative writers so long
as feudalism continued in vigour, for feudalism effectually
controlled by express customs the exorbitant theoretical
pretensions of most European sovereigns. It is notorious,
however, that as soon as the decay of the Feudal System had
thrown the medi&aelig;val constitutions out of working order, and
when the Reformation had discredited the authority of the
Pope, the doctrine of the divine right of Kings rose immediately
into an importance which had never before attended it.
The vogue which it obtained entailed still more constant
resort to the phraseology of Roman law, and a controversy
which had originally worn a theological aspect assumed more
and more the air of a legal disputation. A phenomenon
then appeared which has repeatedly shown itself in the history
of opinion. Just when the argument for monarchical
authority rounded itself into the definite doctrine of Filmer,
the phraseology, borrowed from the Law of Contract, which
had been used in defence of the rights of subjects, crystallised
into the theory of an actual original compact between king
and people, a theory which, first in English and afterwards,
and more particularly, in French hands, expanded into a
comprehensive explanation of all the phenomena of society
and law. But the only real connection between political and
legal science had consisted in the last giving to the first the
benefit of its peculiarly plastic terminology. The Roman
jurisprudence of Contract had performed for the relation of
sovereign and subject precisely the same service which, in a
humbler sphere, it rendered to the relation of persons bound
together by an obligation of "quasi-contract." It had furnished
a body of words and phrases which approximated with
sufficient accuracy to the ideas which then were from time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to time forming on the subject of political obligation. The
doctrine of an Original Compact can never be put higher
than it is placed by Dr. Whewell, when he suggests that,
though unsound, "it may be a <i>convenient</i> form for the expression
of moral truths."</p>

<p>The extensive employment of legal language on political
subjects previously to the invention of the Original Compact,
and the powerful influence which that assumption has
exercised subsequently, amply account for the plentifulness
in political science of words and conceptions, which were the
exclusive creation of Roman jurisprudence. Of their plentifulness
in Moral Philosophy a rather different explanation
must be given, inasmuch as ethical writings have laid
Roman law under contribution much more directly than
political speculations, and their authors have been much
more conscious of the extent of their obligation. In speaking
of moral philosophy as extraordinarily indebted to Roman
jurisprudence, I must be understood to intend moral philosophy
as understood previously to the break in its history
effected by Kant, that is, as the science of the rules governing
human conduct, of their proper interpretation and of the
limitations to which they are subject. Since the rise of the
Critical Philosophy, moral science has almost wholly lost its
older meaning, and, except where it is preserved under a
debased form in the casuistry still cultivated by Roman
Catholic theologians, it seems to be regarded nearly universally
as a branch of ontological inquiry. I do not know that
there is a single contemporary English writer, with the exception
of Dr. Whewell, who understands moral philosophy
as it was understood before it was absorbed by metaphysics
and before the groundwork of its rules came to be a more
important consideration than the rules themselves. So long,
however, as ethical science had to do with the practical
regimen of conduct, it was more or less saturated with Roman
law. Like all the great subjects of modern thought, it was
originally incorporated with theology. The science of Moral
Theology, as it was at first called, and as it is still designated
by the Roman Catholic divines, was undoubtedly constructed,
to the full knowledge of its authors, by taking principles of
conduct from the system of the Church, and by using the
language and methods of jurisprudence for their expression
and expansion. While this process went on, it was inevitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that jurisprudence, though merely intended to be the vehicle
of thought, should communicate its colour to the thought
itself. The tinge received through contact with legal conceptions
is perfectly perceptible in the earliest ethical literature
of the modern world, and it is evident, I think, that the
Law of Contract, based as it is on the complete reciprocity
and indissoluble connection of rights and duties, has acted as
a wholesome corrective to the predispositions of writers who,
if left to themselves, might have exclusively viewed a moral
obligation as the public duty of a citizen in the Civitas Dei.
But the amount of Roman Law in moral theology becomes
sensibly smaller at the time of its cultivation by the great
Spanish moralists. Moral theology, developed by the juridical
method of doctor commenting on doctor, provided itself
with a phraseology of its own, and Aristotelian peculiarities
of reasoning and expression, imbibed doubtless in great
part from the Disputations on Morals in the academical
schools, take the place of that special turn of thought and
speech which can never be mistaken by any person conversant
with the Roman law. If the credit of the Spanish school of
moral theologians had continued, the juridical ingredient
in ethical science would have been insignificant, but the use
made of their conclusions by the next generation of Roman
Catholic writers on these subjects almost entirely destroyed
their influence. Moral Theology, degraded into Casuistry,
lost all interest for the leaders of European speculation;
and the new science of Moral Philosophy, which was entirely
in the hands of the Protestants, swerved greatly aside from
the path which the moral theologians had followed. The
effect was vastly to increase the influence of Roman law on
ethical inquiry.</p>

<p>Shortly<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> after the Reformation, we find two great schools
of thought dividing this class of subjects between them. The
most influential of the two was at first the sect of school
known to us as the Casuists, all of them in spiritual communion
with the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly all of
them affiliated to one or other of her religious orders. On the
other side were a body of writers connected with each other
by a common intellectual descent from the great author of
the treatise <i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i>, Hugo Grotius. Almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>all of the latter were adherents of the Reformation, and though
it cannot be said that they were formally and avowedly at
conflict with the Casuists, the origin and object of their
system were nevertheless essentially different from those of
Casuistry. It is necessary to call attention to this difference,
because it involves the question of the influence of Roman
law on that department of thought with which both systems
are concerned. The book of Grotius, though it touches questions
of pure Ethics in every page, and though it is the parent
immediate or remote of innumerable volumes of formal
morality, is not, as is well known, a professed treatise on
Moral Philosophy; it is an attempt to determine the Law
of Nature, or Natural Law. Now, without entering upon the
question, whether the conception of a Law Natural be not
exclusively a creation of the Roman jurisconsults, we may
lay down that, even on the admission of Grotius himself,
the dicta of the Roman jurisprudence as to what parts of
known positive law must be taken to be parts of the Law
of Nature, are, if not infallible, to be received at all events
with the profoundest respect. Hence the system of Grotius
is implicated with Roman law at its very foundation, and
this connection rendered inevitable&mdash;what the legal training
of the writer would perhaps have entailed without it&mdash;the
free employment in every paragraph of technical phraseology,
and of modes of reasoning, defining, and illustrating, which
must sometimes conceal the sense, and almost always the
force and cogency, of the argument from the reader who is
unfamiliar with the sources whence they have been derived.
On the other hand, Casuistry borrows little from Roman law,
and the views of morality contended for have nothing whatever
in common with the undertaking of Grotius. All that
philosophy of right and wrong which has become famous, or
infamous, under the name of Casuistry, had its origin in the
distinction between Mortal and Venial Sin. A natural anxiety
to escape the awful consequences of determining a particular
act to be mortally sinful, and a desire, equally intelligible, to
assist the Roman Catholic Church in its conflict with Protestantism
by disburthening it of an inconvenient theory, were
the motives which impelled the authors of the Casuistical
philosophy to the invention of an elaborate system of criteria,
intended to remove immoral actions, in as many cases as
possible, out of the category of mortal offences, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
stamp them as venial sins. The fate of this experiment is
matter of ordinary history. We know that the distinctions of
Casuistry, by enabling the priesthood to adjust spiritual control
to all the varieties of human character, did really confer
on it an influence with princes, statesmen, and generals, unheard
of in the ages before the Reformation, and did really
contribute largely to that great reaction which checked and
narrowed the first successes of Protestantism. But beginning
in the attempt, not to establish, but to evade&mdash;not to discover
a principle, but to escape a postulate&mdash;not to settle
the nature of right and wrong, but to determine what was
not wrong of a particular nature,&mdash;Casuistry went on with
its dexterous refinements till it ended in so attenuating the
moral features of actions, and so belying the moral instincts
of our being, that at length the conscience of mankind rose
suddenly in revolt against it, and consigned to one common
ruin the system and its doctors. The blow, long pending, was
finally struck in the <i>Provincial Letters</i> of Pascal, and since the
appearance of those memorable Papers, no moralist of the
smallest influence or credit has ever avowedly conducted his
speculations in the footsteps of the Casuists. The whole field
of ethical science was thus left at the exclusive command of
the writers who followed Grotius; and it still exhibits in an
extraordinary degree the traces of that entanglement with
Roman law which is sometimes imputed as a fault, and sometimes
the highest of its recommendations, to the Grotian
theory. Many inquirers since Grotius's day have modified his
principles, and many, of course, since the rise of the Critical
Philosophy, have quite deserted them; but even those who
have departed most widely from his fundamental assumptions
have inherited much of his method of statement, of his train
of thought, and of his mode of illustration; and these have
little meaning and no point to the person ignorant of Roman
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>I have already said that, with the exception of the physical
sciences, there is no walk of knowledge which has been so
slightly affected by Roman law as Metaphysics. The reason
is that discussion on metaphysical subjects has always been
conducted in Greek, first in pure Greek, and afterwards in a
dialect of Latin expressly constructed to give expression to
Greek conceptions. The modern languages have only been
fitted to metaphysical inquiries by adopting this Latin dialect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
or by imitating the process which was originally followed in
its formation. The source of the phraseology which has been
always employed for metaphysical discussion in modern
times was the Latin translations of Aristotle, in which,
whether derived or not from Arabic versions, the plan of the
translator was not to seek for analogous expressions in any
part of Latin literature, but to construct anew from Latin
roots a set of phrases equal to the expression of Greek philosophical
ideas. Over such a process the terminology of
Roman law can have exercised little influence; at most, a
few Latin law terms in a transmuted shape have made their
way into metaphysical language. At the same time it is
worthy of remark that whenever the problems of metaphysics
are those which have been most strongly agitated in Western
Europe, the thought, if not the language, betrays a legal
parentage. Few things in the history of speculation are more
impressive than the fact that no Greek-speaking people has
ever felt itself seriously perplexed by the great question of
Free-will and Necessity. I do not pretend to offer any summary
explanation of this, but it does not seem an irrelevant
suggestion that neither the Greeks, nor any society speaking
and thinking in their language, ever showed the smallest
capacity for producing a philosophy of law. Legal science
is a Roman creation, and the problem of Free-will arises when
we contemplate a metaphysical conception under a legal
aspect. How came it to be a question whether invariable
sequence was identical with necessary connection? I can
only say that the tendency of Roman law, which became
stronger as it advanced, was to look upon legal consequences
as united to legal causes by an inexorable necessity, a tendency
most markedly exemplified in the definition of Obligation
which I have repeatedly cited, "Juris vinculum quo
necessitate adstringimur alicujus solvend&aelig; rei."</p>

<p>But the problem of Free-will was theological before it
became philosophical, and, if its terms have been affected
by jurisprudence, it will be because Jurisprudence had made
itself felt in Theology. The great point of inquiry which is
here suggested has never been satisfactorily elucidated. What
has to be determined, is whether jurisprudence has ever
served as the medium through which theological principles
have been viewed; whether, by supplying a peculiar language,
a peculiar mode of reasoning, and a peculiar solution of many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the problems of life, it has ever opened new channels in
which theological speculation could flow out and expand
itself. For the purpose of giving an answer it is necessary
to recollect what is already agreed upon by the best writers
as to the intellectual food which theology first assimilated.
It is conceded on all sides that the earliest language of the
Christian Church was Greek, and that the problems to which
it first addressed itself were those for which Greek philosophy
in its later forms had prepared the way. Greek metaphysical
literature contained the sole stock of words and ideas out of
which the human mind could provide itself with the means
of engaging in the profound controversies as to the Divine
Persons, the Divine Substance, and the Divine Natures. The
Latin language and the meagre Latin philosophy were quite
unequal to the undertaking, and accordingly the Western
or Latin-speaking provinces of the Empire adopted the conclusions
of the East without disputing or reviewing them.
"Latin Christianity," says Dean Milman, "accepted the
creed which its narrow and barren vocabulary could hardly
express in adequate terms. Yet, throughout, the adhesion
of Rome and the West was a passive acquiescence in the
dogmatic system which had been wrought out by the profounder
theology of the Eastern divines, rather than a
vigorous and original examination on her part of those
mysteries. The Latin Church was the scholar as well as the
loyal partizan of Athanasius." But when the separation of
East and West became wider, and the Latin-speaking Western
Empire began to live with an intellectual life of its own, its
deference to the East was all at once exchanged for the
agitation of a number of questions entirely foreign to Eastern
speculation. "While Greek theology (Milman, <i>Latin Christianity</i>,
Preface, 5) went on defining with still more exquisite
subtlety the Godhead and the nature of Christ"&mdash;"while
the interminable controversy still lengthened out and cast
forth sect after sect from the enfeebled community"&mdash;the
Western Church threw itself with passionate ardour into a
new order of disputes, the same which from those days to
this have never lost their interest for any family of mankind
at any time included in the Latin communion. The nature
of Sin and its transmission by inheritance&mdash;the debt owed by
man and its vicarious satisfaction&mdash;the necessity and sufficiency
of the Atonement&mdash;above all the apparent antagonism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
between Free-will and the Divine Providence&mdash;these were
the points which the West began to debate as ardently as
ever the East had discussed the articles of its more special
creed. Why is it then that on the two sides of the line which
divides the Greek-speaking from the Latin-speaking provinces
there lie two classes of theological problems so strikingly
different from one another? The historians of the Church
have come close upon the solution when they remark that
the new problems were more "practical," less absolutely
speculative, than those which had torn Eastern Christianity
asunder, but none of them, so far as I am aware, has quite
reached it. I affirm without hesitation that the difference
between the two theological systems is accounted for by the
fact that, in passing from the East to the West, theological
speculation had passed from a climate of Greek metaphysics
to a climate of Roman law. For some centuries before these
controversies rose into overwhelming importance, all the
intellectual activity of the Western Romans had been expended
on jurisprudence exclusively. They had been occupied
in applying a peculiar set of principles to all the combinations
in which the circumstances of life are capable of being
arranged. No foreign pursuit or taste called off their attention
from this engrossing occupation, and for carrying it on they
possessed a vocabulary as accurate as it was copious, a strict
method of reasoning, a stock of general propositions on conduct
more or less verified by experience, and a rigid moral
philosophy. It was impossible that they should not select
from the questions indicated by the Christian records those
which had some affinity with the order of speculations to
which they were accustomed, and that their manner of
dealing with them should borrow something from their
forensic habits. Almost everybody who has knowledge enough
of Roman law to appreciate the Roman penal system, the
Roman theory of the obligations established by Contract or
Delict, the Roman view of Debts and of the modes of incurring,
extinguishing, and transmitting them, the Roman
notion of the continuance of individual existence by Universal
Succession, may be trusted to say whence arose the frame
of mind to which the problems of Western theology proved
so congenial, whence came the phraseology in which these
problems were stated, and whence the description of reasoning
employed in their solution. It must only be recollected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Roman law which had worked itself into Western thought
was neither the archaic system of the ancient city, nor the
pruned and curtailed jurisprudence of the Byzantine Emperors;
still less, of course, was it the mass of rules, nearly
buried in a parasitical overgrowth of modern speculative
doctrine, which passes by the name of Modern Civil Law.
I speak only of that philosophy of jurisprudence, wrought
out by the great juridical thinkers of the Antonine age, which
may still be partially reproduced from the Pandects of
Justinian, a system to which few faults can be attributed
except it perhaps aimed at a higher degree of elegance,
certainty, and precision, than human affairs will permit to
the limits within which human laws seek to confine them.</p>

<p>It is a singular result of that ignorance of Roman law which
Englishmen readily confess, and of which they are sometimes
not ashamed to boast, that many English writers of note
and credit have been led by it to put forward the most
untenable of paradoxes concerning the condition of human
intellect during the Roman Empire. It has been constantly
asserted, as unhesitatingly as if there were no temerity in
advancing the proposition, that from the close of the Augustan
era to the general awakening of interest on the points of the
Christian faith, the mental energies of the civilised world
were smitten with a paralysis. Now there are two subjects
of thought&mdash;the only two perhaps with the exception of
physical science&mdash;which are able to give employment to all
the powers and capacities which the mind possesses. One
of them is Metaphysical inquiry, which knows no limits so
long as the mind is satisfied to work on itself; the other is
Law, which is as extensive as the concerns of mankind. It
happens that, during the very period indicated, the Greek-speaking
provinces were devoted to one, the Latin-speaking
provinces to the other, of these studies. I say nothing of the
fruits of speculation in Alexandria and the East, but I confidently
affirm that Rome and the West had an occupation
in hand fully capable of compensating them for the absence
of every other mental exercise, and I add that the results
achieved, so far as we know them, were not unworthy of the
continuous and exclusive labour bestowed on producing them.
Nobody except a professional lawyer is perhaps in a position
completely to understand how much of the intellectual
strength of individuals Law is capable of absorbing, but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
layman has no difficulty in comprehending why it was that
an unusual share of the collective intellect of Rome was
engrossed by jurisprudence. "The proficiency<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>] of a given
community in jurisprudence depends in the long run on the
same conditions as its progress in any other line of inquiry;
and the chief of these are the proportion of the national
intellect devoted to it, and the length of time during which
it is so devoted. Now, a combination of all the causes, direct
and indirect, which contribute to the advancing and perfecting
of a science continued to operate on the jurisprudence
of Rome through the entire space between the Twelve Tables
and the severance of the two Empires,&mdash;and that not irregularly
or at intervals, but in steadily increasing force and constantly
augmenting number. We should reflect that the
earliest intellectual exercise to which a young nation devotes
itself is the study of its laws. As soon as the mind makes its
first conscious efforts towards generalisation, the concerns
of every-day life are the first to press for inclusion within
general rules and comprehensive formulas. The popularity
of the pursuit on which all the energies of the young commonwealth
are bent is at the outset unbounded; but it ceases in
time. The monopoly of mind by law is broken down. The
crowd at the morning audience of the great Roman jurisconsult
lessens. The students are counted by hundreds
instead of thousands in the English Inns of Court. Art,
Literature, Science, and Politics, claim their share of the
national intellect; and the practice of jurisprudence is confined
within the circle of a profession, never indeed limited
or insignificant, but attracted as much by the rewards as by
the intrinsic recommendations of their science. This succession
of changes exhibited itself even more strikingly
at Rome than in England. To the close of the Republic the
law was the sole field for all ability except the special talent
of a capacity for generalship. But a new stage of intellectual
progress began with the Augustan age, as it did with our
own Elizabethan era. We all know what were its achievements
in poetry and prose; but there are some indications,
it should be remarked, that, besides its efflorescence in
ornamental literature, it was on the eve of throwing out
new aptitudes for conquest in physical science. Here, however,
is the point at which the history of mind in the Roman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>State ceases to be parallel to the routes which mental progress
had since then pursued. The brief span of Roman
literature, strictly so called, was suddenly closed under a
variety of influences, which though they may partially be
traced it would be improper in this place to analyse. Ancient
intellect was forcibly thrust back into its old courses, and
law again became no less exclusively the proper sphere for
talent than it had been in the days when the Romans despised
philosophy and poetry as the toys of a childish race.
Of what nature were the external inducements which, during
the Imperial period, tended to draw a man of inherent
capacity to the pursuits of the jurisconsult may best be
understood by considering the option which was practically
before him in his choice of a profession. He might become a
teacher of rhetoric, a commander of frontier-posts, or a professional
writer of panegyrics. The only other walk of active
life which was open to him was the practice of the law. Through
<i>that</i> lay the approach to wealth, to fame, to office, to the
council-chamber of the monarch&mdash;it may be to the very
throne itself."</p>

<p>The premium on the study of jurisprudence was so enormous
that there were schools of law in every part of the Empire,
even in the very domain of Metaphysics. But, though the
transfer of the seat of empire to Byzantium gave a perceptible
impetus to its cultivation in the East, jurisprudence never
dethroned the pursuits which there competed with it. Its
language was Latin, an exotic dialect in the Eastern half of
the Empire. It is only of the West that we can lay down
that law was not only the mental food of the ambitious and
aspiring, but the sole aliment of all intellectual activity.
Greek philosophy had never been more than a transient
fashionable taste with the educated class of Rome itself, and
when the new Eastern capital had been created, and the
Empire subsequently divided into two, the divorce of the
Western provinces from Greek speculation, and their exclusive
devotion to jurisprudence, became more decided than
ever. As soon then as they ceased to sit at the feet of the
Greeks and began to ponder out a theology of their own, the
theology proved to be permeated with forensic ideas and
couched in a forensic phraseology. It is certain that this
substratum of law in Western theology lies exceedingly
deep. A new set of Greek theories, the Aristotelian philosophy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
made their way afterwards into the West and almost
entirely buried its indigenous doctrines. But when at the
Reformation it partially shook itself free from their influence,
it instantly supplied their place with Law. It is difficult
to say whether the religious system of Calvin or the religious
system of the Arminians has the more markedly legal
character.</p>

<p>The vast influence of the specific jurisprudence of Contract
produced by the Romans upon the corresponding department
of modern Law belongs rather to the history of mature jurisprudence
than to a treatise like the present. It did not make
itself felt till the school of Bologna founded the legal science
of modern Europe. But the fact that the Romans, before
their Empire fell, had so fully developed the conception of
Contract becomes of importance at a much earlier period than
this. Feudalism, I have repeatedly asserted, was a compound of
archaic barbarian usage with Roman law; no other explanation
of it is tenable, or even intelligible. The earliest social
forms of the feudal period differ in little from the ordinary
associations in which the men of primitive civilisations are
everywhere seen united. A Fief was an organically complete
brotherhood of associates whose proprietary and personal
rights were inextricably blended together. It had much in
common with an Indian Village Community and much in
common with a Highland clan. But still it presents some
phenomena which we never find in the associations which
are spontaneously formed by beginners in civilisation. True
archaic communities are held together not by express rules,
but by sentiment, or, we should perhaps say, by instinct;
and new comers into the brotherhood are brought within the
range of this instinct by falsely pretending to share in the blood-relationship
from which it naturally springs. But the earliest
feudal communities were neither bound together by mere
sentiment nor recruited by a fiction. The tie which united
them was Contract, and they obtained new associates by
contracting with them. The relation of the lord to the vassals
had originally been settled by express engagement, and a
person wishing to engraft himself on the brotherhood by
<i>commendation</i> or <i>infeudation</i> came to a distinct understanding
as to the conditions on which he was to be admitted. It is
therefore the sphere occupied in them by Contract which
principally distinguishes the feudal institutions from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
unadulterated usages of primitive races. The lord had many
of the characteristics of a patriarchal chieftain, but his prerogative
was limited by a variety of settled customs traceable
to the express conditions which had been agreed upon when
the infeudation took place. Hence flow the chief differences
which forbid us to class the feudal societies with true archaic
communities. They were much more durable and much more
various; more durable, because express rules are less destructible
than instinctive habits, and more various, because
the contracts on which they were founded were adjusted to
the minutest circumstances and wishes of the persons who
surrendered or granted away their lands. This last consideration
may serve to indicate how greatly the vulgar opinions
current among us as to the origin of modern society stand
in need of revision. It is often said that the irregular and
various contour of modern civilisation is due to the exuberant
and erratic genius of the Germanic races, and it is often contrasted
with the dull routine of the Roman Empire. The
truth is that the Empire bequeathed to modern society the
legal conception to which all this irregularity is attributable;
if the customs and institutions of barbarians have one
characteristic more striking than another, it is their extreme
uniformity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the early history of delict and crime</span></h4>


<p>The Teutonic Codes, including those of our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors, are the only bodies of archaic secular law which
have come down to us in such a state that we can form an
exact notion of their original dimensions. Although the
extant fragments of Roman and Hellenic codes suffice to
prove to us their general character, there does not remain
enough of them for us to be quite sure of their precise magnitude
or of the proportion of their parts to each other. But
still on the whole all the known collections of ancient law
are characterised by a feature which broadly distinguishes
them from systems of mature jurisprudence. The proportion
of criminal to civil law is exceedingly different. In the
German codes, the civil part of the law has trifling dimensions
as compared with the criminal. The traditions which speak
of the sanguinary penalties inflicted by the code of Draco
seem to indicate that it had the same characteristic. In
the Twelve Tables alone, produced by a society of greater
legal genius and at first of gentler manners, the civil law has
something like its modern precedence; but the relative
amount of space given to the modes of redressing wrong,
though not enormous, appears to have been large. It may
be laid down, I think, that the more archaic the code, the
fuller and the minuter is its penal legislation. The phenomenon
has often been observed, and has been explained, no
doubt to a great extent correctly, by the violence habitual
to the communities which for the first time reduced their
laws to writing. The legislator, it is said, proportioned the
divisions of his work to the frequency of a certain class of
incidents in barbarian life. I imagine, however, that this
account is not quite complete. It should be recollected that
the comparative barrenness of civil law in archaic collections
is consistent with those other characteristics of ancient jurisprudence
which have been discussed in this treatise. Nine-tenths
of the civil part of the law practised by civilised societies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
are made up of the Law of Persons, of the Law of Property
and of Inheritance, and of the Law of Contract. But it is
plain that all these provinces of jurisprudence must shrink
within narrower boundaries, the nearer we make our approaches
to the infancy of social brotherhood. The Law of Persons,
which is nothing else than the Law of Status, will be restricted
to the scantiest limits as long as all forms of status are merged
in common subjection to Paternal Power, as long as the
Wife has no rights against her Husband, the Son none against
his Father, and the infant Ward none against the Agnates
who are his Guardians. Similarly, the rules relating to
Property and Succession can never be plentiful, so long as
land and goods devolve within the family, and, if distributed
at all, are distributed inside its circle. But the greatest gap
in ancient civil law will always be caused by the absence of
Contract, which some archaic codes do not mention at all,
while others significantly attest the immaturity of the moral
notions on which Contract depends by supplying its place
with an elaborate jurisprudence of Oaths. There are no
corresponding reasons for the poverty of penal law, and
accordingly, even if it be hazardous to pronounce that the
childhood of nations is always a period of ungoverned violence,
we shall still be able to understand why the modern relation
of criminal law to civil should be inverted in ancient
codes.</p>

<p>I have spoken of primitive jurisprudence as giving to
<i>criminal</i> law a priority unknown in a later age. The expression
has been used for convenience' sake, but in fact the
inspection of ancient codes shows that the law which they
exhibit in unusual quantities is not true criminal law. All
civilised systems agree in drawing a distinction between
offences against the State or Community and offences against
the Individual, and the two classes of injuries, thus kept
apart, I may here, without pretending that the terms have
always been employed consistently in jurisprudence, call
Crimes and Wrongs, <i>crimina</i> and <i>delicta</i>. Now the penal law
of ancient communities is not the law of Crimes; it is the
law of Wrongs, or, to use the English technical word, of Torts.
The person injured proceeds against the wrong-doer by an
ordinary civil action, and recovers compensation in the shape
of money-damages if he succeeds. If the Commentaries of
Gaius be opened at the place where the writer treats of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
penal jurisprudence founded on the Twelve Tables, it will be
seen that at the head of the civil wrongs recognised by the
Roman law stood <i>Furtum</i> or <i>Theft</i>. Offences which we are
accustomed to regard exclusively as <i>crimes</i> are exclusively
treated as <i>torts</i>, and not theft only, but assault and violent
robbery, are associated by the jurisconsult with trespass,
libel and slander. All alike gave rise to an Obligation or
<i>vinculum juris</i>, and were all requited by a payment of money.
This peculiarity, however, is most strongly brought out in
the consolidated Laws of the Germanic tribes. Without an
exception, they describe an immense system of money compensations
for homicide, and with few exceptions, as large
a scheme of compensations for minor injuries. "Under
Anglo-Saxon law," writes Mr. Kemble (<i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, i. 177),
"a sum was placed on the life of every free man, according to
his rank, and a corresponding sum on every wound that could
be inflicted on his person, for nearly every injury that could
be done to his civil rights, honour or peace; the sum being
aggravated according to adventitious circumstances." These
compositions are evidently regarded as a valuable source of
income; highly complex rules regulate the title to them and
the responsibility for them; and, as I have already had occasion
to state, they often follow a very peculiar line of devolution,
if they have not been acquitted at the decease of the
person to whom they belong. If therefore the criterion of a
<i>delict</i>, <i>wrong</i>, or <i>tort</i> be that the person who suffers it, and not
the State, is conceived to be wronged, it may be asserted that
in the infancy of jurisprudence the citizen depends for protection
against violence or fraud not on the Law of Crime but
on the Law of Tort.</p>

<p>Torts then are copiously enlarged upon in primitive jurisprudence.
It must be added that Sins are known to it also.
Of the Teutonic codes it is almost unnecessary to make this
assertion, because those codes, in the form in which we have
received them, were compiled or recast by Christian legislators.
But it is also true that non-Christian bodies of archaic law
entail penal consequences on certain classes of acts and on
certain classes of omissions, as being violations of divine
prescriptions and commands. The law administered at
Athens by the Senate of Areopagus was probably a special
religious code, and at Rome, apparently from a very early
period, the Pontifical jurisprudence punished adultery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
sacrilege and perhaps murder. There were therefore in
the Athenian and in the Roman States laws punishing <i>sins</i>.
There were also laws punishing <i>torts</i>. The conception of
offence against God produced the first class of ordinances;
the conception of offence against one's neighbour produced
the second; but the idea of offence against the State or
aggregate community did not at first produce a true criminal
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Yet it is not to be supposed that a conception so simple
and elementary as that of wrong done to the State was wanting
in any primitive society. It seems rather that the very
distinctness with which this conception is realised is the true
cause which at first prevents the growth of a criminal law.
At all events, when the Roman community conceived itself
to be injured, the analogy of a personal wrong received was
carried out to its consequences with absolute literalness, and
the State avenged itself by a single act on the individual
wrong-doer. The result was that, in the infancy of the
commonwealth, every offence vitally touching its security
or its interests was punished by a separate enactment of the
legislature. And this is the earliest conception of a <i>crimen</i>
or Crime&mdash;an act involving such high issues that the State,
instead of leaving its cognisance to the civil tribunal or the
religious court, directed a special law or <i>privilegium</i> against
the perpetrator. Every indictment therefore took the form
of a bill of pains and penalties, and the trial of a <i>criminal</i> was
a proceeding wholly extraordinary, wholly irregular, wholly
independent of settled rules and fixed conditions. Consequently,
both for the reason that the tribunal dispensing
justice was the sovereign state itself and also for the reason
that no classification of the acts prescribed or forbidden was
possible, there was not at this epoch any <i>Law</i> of crimes, any
criminal jurisprudence. The procedure was identical with
the forms of passing an ordinary statute; it was set in motion
by the same persons and conducted with precisely the same
solemnities. And it is to be observed that, when a regular
criminal law with an apparatus of Courts and officers for its
administration had afterwards come into being, the old
procedure, as might be supposed from its conformity with
theory, still in strictness remained practicable; and, much
as resort to such an expedient was discredited, the people of
Rome always retained the power of punishing by a special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
law offences against its majesty. The classical scholar does
not require to be reminded that in exactly the same manner
the Athenian Bill of Pains and Penalties, or &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#8055;&#945;, survived
the establishment of regular tribunals. It is known
too that when the freemen of the Teutonic races assembled
for legislation, they also claimed authority to punish offences
of peculiar blackness or perpetrated by criminals of exalted
station. Of this nature was the criminal jurisdiction of the
Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the difference which I have asserted
to exist between the ancient and modern view of penal law
has only a verbal existence. The community, it may be
said, besides interposing to punish crimes legislatively, has
from the earliest times interfered by its tribunals to compel
the wrong-doer to compound for his wrong, and, if it does
this, it must always have supposed that in some way it was
injured through his offence. But, however rigorous this
inference may seem to us now-a-days, it is very doubtful
whether it was actually drawn by the men of primitive antiquity.
How little the notion of injury to the community
had to do with the earliest interferences of the State <i>through
its tribunals</i>, is shown by the curious circumstances that in
the original administration of justice, the proceedings were a
close imitation of the series of acts which were likely to be
gone through in private life by persons who were disputing,
but who afterwards suffered their quarrel to be appeased.
The magistrate carefully simulated the demeanour of a
private arbitrator casually called in.</p>

<p>In order to show that this statement is not a mere fanciful
conceit, I will produce the evidence on which it rests. Very
far the most ancient judicial proceeding known to us is the
Legis Actio Sacramenti of the Romans, out of which all the
later Roman Law of Actions may be proved to have grown.
Gaius carefully describes its ceremonial. Unmeaning and
grotesque as it appears at first sight, a little attention enables
us to decipher and interpret it.</p>

<p>The subject of litigation is supposed to be in Court. If it
is moveable, it is actually there. If it be immoveable, a
fragment or sample of it is brought in its place; land, for
instance, is represented by a clod, a house by a single brick.
In the example selected by Gaius, the suit is for a slave. The
proceeding begins by the plaintiff's advancing with a rod,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
which, as Gaius expressly tells, symbolised a spear. He lays
hold of the slave and asserts a right to him with the words,
"<i>Hunc ego hominem ex Jure Quiritium meum esse dico secundum
suam causam sicut dixi</i>;" and then saying, "<i>Ecce tibi
Vindictam imposui</i>," he touches him with the spear. The
defendant goes through the same series of acts and gestures.
On this the Pr&aelig;tor intervenes, and bids the litigants relax
their hold, "<i>Mittite ambo hominem</i>." They obey, and the
plaintiff demands from the defendant the reason of his interference,
"<i>Postulo anne dicas qu&acirc; ex caus&acirc; vindicaveris</i>," a
question which is replied to by a fresh assertion of right,
"<i>Jus peregi sicut vindictam imposui</i>." On this, the first
claimant offers to stake a sum of money, called a Sacramentum,
on the justice of his own case, "<i>Quando tu injuri&acirc;
provocasti, D &aelig;ris Sacramento te provoco</i>," and the defendant,
in the phrase "<i>Similiter ego te</i>," accepts the wager. The
subsequent proceedings were no longer of a formal kind, but
it is to be observed that the Pr&aelig;tor took security for the
Sacramentum, which always went into the coffers of the State.</p>

<p>Such was the necessary preface of every ancient Roman
suit. It is impossible, I think, to refuse assent to the suggestion
of those who see in it a dramatisation of the Origin of
Justice. Two armed men are wrangling about some disputed
property. The Pr&aelig;tor, <i>vir pietate gravis</i>, happens to be
going by, and interposes to stop the contest. The disputants
state their case to him, and agree that he shall arbitrate
between them, it being arranged that the loser, besides
resigning the subject of the quarrel, shall pay a sum of money
to the umpire as remuneration for his trouble and loss of
time. This interpretation would be less plausible than it is,
were it not that, by a surprising coincidence, the ceremony
described by Gaius as the imperative course of proceeding
in a Legis Actio is substantially the same with one of the two
subjects which the God Heph&aelig;stus is described by Homer
as moulding into the First Compartment of the Shield of
Achilles. In the Homeric trial-scene, the dispute, as if
expressly intended to bring out the characteristics of primitive
society, is not about property but about the composition for
a homicide. One person asserts that he has paid it, the other
that he has never received it. The point of detail, however,
which stamps the picture as the counterpart of the archaic
Roman practice is the reward designed for the judges. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
talents of gold lie in the middle, to be given to him who shall
explain the grounds of the decision most to the satisfaction of
the audience. The magnitude of this sum as compared with
the trifling amount of the Sacramentum seems to me indicative
of the indifference between fluctuating usage and usage
consolidated into law. The scene introduced by the poet
as a striking and characteristic, but still only occasional,
feature of city-life in the heroic age has stiffened, at the
opening of the history of civil process, into the regular,
ordinary formalities of a lawsuit. It is natural therefore
that in the Legis Actio the remuneration of the Judge should
be reduced to a reasonable sum, and that, instead of being
adjudged to one of a number of arbitrators by popular
acclamation, it should be paid as a matter of course to the
State which the Pr&aelig;tor represents. But that the incidents
described so vividly by Homer, and by Gaius with even more
than the usual crudity of technical language, have substantially
the same meaning, I cannot doubt; and, in confirmation
of this view, it may be added that many observers of the earliest
judicial usages of modern Europe have remarked that the
fines inflicted by Courts on offenders were originally <i>sacramenta</i>.
The State did not take from the defendant a composition
for any wrong supposed to be done to itself, but claimed
a share in the compensation awarded to the plaintiff simply
as the fair price of its time and trouble. Mr. Kemble expressly
assigns this character to the Anglo-Saxon <i>bannum</i> or
<i>fredum</i>.</p>

<p>Ancient law furnishes other proofs that the earliest
administrators of justice simulated the probable acts of
persons engaged in a private quarrel. In settling the damages
to be awarded, they took as their guide the measure of
vengeance likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person under
the circumstances of the case. This is the true explanation
of the very different penalties imposed by ancient law on
offenders caught in the act or soon after it and on offenders
detected after considerable delay. Some strange exemplifications
of this peculiarity are supplied by the old Roman law
of Theft. The Laws of the Twelve Tables seem to have
divided Thefts into Manifest and Non-Manifest, and to have
allotted extraordinarily different penalties to the offence
according as it fell under one head or the other. The Manifest
Thief was he who was caught within the house in which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
had been pilfering, or who was taken while making off to a
place of safety with the stolen goods; the Twelve Tables
condemned him to be put to death if he were already a slave,
and, if he was a freeman, they made him the bondsman of
the owner of the property. The Non-Manifest Thief was he
who was detected under any other circumstances than those
described; and the old code simply directed that an offender
of this sort should refund double the value of what he had
stolen. In Gaius's day the excessive severity of the Twelve
Tables to the Manifest Thief had naturally been much mitigated,
but the law still maintained the old principle by mulcting
him in fourfold the value of the stolen goods, while the
Non-Manifest Thief still continued to pay merely the double.
The ancient lawgiver doubtless considered that the injured
proprietor, if left to himself, would inflict a very different
punishment when his blood was hot from that with which
he would be satisfied when the Thief was detected after a
considerable interval; and to this calculation the legal scale
of penalties was adjusted. The principle is precisely the
same as that followed in the Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic
codes, when they suffer a thief chased down and caught with
the booty to be hanged or decapitated on the spot, while they
exact the full penalties of homicide from anybody who kills
him after the pursuit has been intermitted. These archaic
distinctions bring home to us very forcibly the distance of a
refined from a rude jurisprudence. The modern administrator
of justice has confessedly one of the hardest tasks before
him when he undertakes to discriminate between the degrees
of criminality which belong to offences falling within the same
technical description. It is always easy to say that a man
is guilty of manslaughter, larceny, or bigamy, but it is often
most difficult to pronounce what extent of moral guilt he
has incurred, and consequently what measure of punishment
he has deserved. There is hardly any perplexity in casuistry,
or in the analysis of motive, which we may not be called upon
to confront, if we attempt to settle such a point with precision;
and accordingly the law of our day shows an increasing
tendency to abstain as much as possible from laying down
positive rules on the subject. In France, the jury is left
to decide whether the offence which it finds committed has
been attended by extenuating circumstances; in England, a
nearly unbounded latitude in the selection of punishments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
is now allowed to the judge; while all States have in reserve an
ultimate remedy for the miscarriages of law in the Prerogative
of Pardon, universally lodged with the Chief Magistrate.
It is curious to observe how little the men of primitive
times were troubled with these scruples, how completely
they were persuaded that the impulses of the injured person
were the proper measure of the vengeance he was entitled to
exact, and how literally they imitated the probable rise and
fall of his passions in fixing their scale of punishment. I wish
it could be said that their method of legislation is quite
extinct. There are, however, several modern systems of
law which, in cases of graver wrong, admit the fact of the
wrong-doer having been taken in the act to be pleaded in
justification of inordinate punishment inflicted on him by
the sufferer&mdash;an indulgence which, though superficially regarded
it may seem intelligible, is based, as it seems to me,
on a very low morality.</p>

<p>Nothing, I have said, can be simpler than the considerations
which ultimately led ancient societies to the formation of a
true criminal jurisprudence. The State conceived itself to
be wronged, and the Popular Assembly struck straight at
the offender with the same movement which accompanied
its legislative action. It is further true of the ancient world&mdash;though
not precisely of the modern, as I shall have occasion
to point out&mdash;that the earliest criminal tribunals were merely
subdivisions, or committees, of the legislature. This, at all
events, is the conclusion pointed at by the legal history of
the two great states of antiquity, with tolerable clearness in
one case, and with absolute distinctness in the other. The
primitive penal law of Athens entrusted the castigation of
offences partly to the Archons, who seem to have punished
them as <i>torts</i>, and partly to the Senate of Areopagus, which
punished them as <i>sins</i>. Both jurisdictions were substantially
transferred in the end to the Heli&aelig;a, the High Court of
Popular Justice, and the functions of the Archons and of the
Areopagus became either merely ministerial or quite insignificant.
But "Heli&aelig;a" is only an old word for Assembly;
the Heli&aelig;a of classical times was simply the Popular Assembly
convened for judicial purposes, and the famous Dikasteries
of Athens were only its subdivisions or panels. The corresponding
changes which occurred at Rome are still more easily
interpreted, because the Romans confined their experiments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to the penal law, and did not, like the Athenians, construct
popular courts with a civil as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The history of Roman criminal jurisprudence begins with
the old Judicia Populi, at which the Kings are said to have
presided. These were simply solemn trials of great offenders
under legislative forms. It seems, however, that from an
early period the Comitia had occasionally delegated its
criminal jurisdiction to a Qu&aelig;stio or Commission, which bore
much the same relation to the Assembly as a Committee of
the House of Commons bears to the House itself, except that
the Roman Commissioners or Qu&aelig;stores did not merely <i>report</i>
to the Comitia, but exercised all powers which that body
was itself in the habit of exercising, even to the passing
sentence on the Accused. A Qu&aelig;stio of this sort was only
appointed to try a particular offender, but there was nothing
to prevent two or three Qu&aelig;stiones sitting at the same time;
and it is probable that several of them were appointed
simultaneously, when several grave cases of wrong to the
community had occurred together. There are also indications
that now and then these Qu&aelig;stiones approached the
character of our <i>Standing</i> Committees, in that they were
appointed periodically, and without waiting for occasion
to arise in the commission of some serious crime. The old
Qu&aelig;stores Parricidii, who are mentioned in connection with
transactions of very ancient date, as being deputed to try
(or, as some take it, to search out and try) all cases of parricide
and murder, seem to have been appointed regularly every
year; and the Duumviri Perduellionis, or Commission of
Two for trial of violent injury to the Commonwealth, are
also believed by most writers to have been named periodically.
The delegations of power to these latter functionaries bring
us some way forwards. Instead of being appointed <i>when and
as</i> state-offences were committed, they had a general, though
a temporary jurisdiction over such as <i>might</i> be perpetrated.
Our proximity to a regular criminal jurisprudence is also
indicated by the general terms "Parricidium" and "Perduellio"
which mark the approach to something like a
classification of crimes.</p>

<p>The true criminal law did not however come into existence
till the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 149, when L. Calpurnius Piso carried the
statute known as the Lex Calpurnia de Repetundis. The law
applied to cases Repetundarum Pecuniarum, that is, claims by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Provincials to recover monies improperly received by a Governor-General,
but the great and permanent importance of this
statute arose from its establishing the first Qu&aelig;stio Perpetua.
A Qu&aelig;stio Perpetua was a <i>Permanent</i> Commission as opposed
to those which were occasional and to those which were
temporary. It was a regular criminal tribunal whose existence
dated from the passing of the statute creating it and
continued till another statute should pass abolishing it. Its
members were not specially nominated, as were the members
of the older Qu&aelig;stiones, but provision was made in the law
constituting it for selecting from particular classes the judges
who were to officiate, and for renewing them in conformity
with definite rules. The offences of which it took cognisance
were also expressly named and defined in this statute, and
the new Qu&aelig;stio had authority to try and sentence all persons
in future whose acts should fall under the definitions of
crime supplied by the law. It was therefore a regular
criminal judicature, administering a true criminal jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The primitive history of criminal law divides itself therefore
into four stages. Understanding that the conception of
<i>Crime</i>, as distinguished from that of <i>Wrong</i> or <i>Tort</i> and from
that of <i>Sin</i>, involves the idea of injury to the State or collective
community, we first find that the commonwealth, in
literal conformity with the conception, itself interposed
directly, and by isolated acts, to avenge itself on the author
of the evil which it had suffered. This is the point from which
we start; each indictment is now a bill of pains and penalties,
a special law naming the criminal and prescribing his punishment.
A <i>second</i> step is accomplished, when the multiplicity
of crimes compels the legislature to delegate its powers to
particular Qu&aelig;stiones or Commissions, each of which is deputed
to investigate a particular accusation, and if it be
proved, to punish the particular offender. Yet <i>another</i> movement
is made when the legislature, instead of waiting for the
alleged commission of a crime as the occasion of appointing
a Qu&aelig;stio, periodically nominates Commissioners like the
Qu&aelig;stores Parricidii and the Duumviri Perduellionis, on the
chance of certain classes of crimes being committed, and in
the expectation that they <i>will</i> be perpetrated. The <i>last</i> stage is
reached when the Qu&aelig;stiones from being periodical or occasional
become permanent Benches or Chambers&mdash;when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
judges, instead of being named in the particular law nominating
the Commission, are directed to be chosen through all
future time in a particular way and from a particular class&mdash;and
when certain acts are described in general language and
declared to be crimes, to be visited, in the event of their
perpetration, with specified penalties appropriated to each
description.</p>

<p>If the Qu&aelig;stiones Perpetu&aelig; had had a longer history, they
would doubtless have come to be regarded as a distinct institution,
and their relation to the Comitia would have
seemed no closer than the connection of our own Courts of
Law with the Sovereign, who is theoretically the fountain of
justice. But the Imperial despotism destroyed them before
their origin had been completely forgotten, and, so long as
they lasted, these Permanent Commissions were looked upon
by the Romans as the mere depositaries of a delegated power.
The cognisance of crimes was considered a natural attribute of
the legislature, and the mind of the citizen never ceased to be
carried back from the Qu&aelig;stiones, to the Comitia which had
deputed them to put into exercise some of its own inalienable
functions. The view which regarded the Qu&aelig;stiones, even
when they became permanent, as mere Committees of the
Popular Assembly&mdash;as bodies which only ministered to a
higher authority&mdash;had some important legal consequences
which left their mark on the criminal law to the very latest
period. One immediate result was that the Comitia continued
to exercise criminal jurisdiction by way of bill of pains
and penalties, long after the Qu&aelig;stiones had been established.
Though the legislature had consented to delegate its powers
for the sake of convenience to bodies external to itself, it
did not follow that it surrendered them. The Comitia and
the Qu&aelig;stiones went on trying and punishing offenders side
by side; and any unusual outburst of popular indignation
was sure, until the extinction of the Republic, to call down
upon its object an indictment before the Assembly of the
Tribes.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable peculiarities of the institutions
of the Republic is also traceable to this dependance of
the Qu&aelig;stiones on the Comitia. The disappearance of the
punishment of Death from the penal system of Republican
Rome used to be a very favourite topic with the writers of
the last century, who were perpetually using it to point some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
theory of the Roman character or of modern social economy.
The reason which can be confidently assigned for it stamps it
as purely fortuitous. Of the three forms which the Roman
legislature successively assumed, one, it is well known&mdash;the
Comitia Centuriata&mdash;was exclusively taken to represent the
State as embodied for military operations. The Assembly of
the Centuries, therefore, had all powers which may be supposed
to be properly lodged with a General commanding an
army, and, among them, it had authority to subject all
offenders to the same correction to which a soldier rendered
himself liable by breaches of discipline. The Comitia Centuriata
could therefore inflict capital punishment. Not so,
however, the Comitia Curiata or Comitia Tributa. They were
fettered on this point by the sacredness with which the person
of a Roman citizen, inside the walls of the city, was invested
by religion and law; and, with respect to the last of them, the
Comitia Tributa, we know for certain that it became a fixed
principle that the Assembly of the Tribes could at most impose
a fine. So long as criminal jurisdiction was confined to
the legislature, and so long as the assemblies of the centuries
and of the Tribes continued to exercise co-ordinate powers,
it was easy to prefer indictments for graver crimes before the
legislative body which dispensed the heavier penalties; but
then it happened that the more democratic assembly, that of
the Tribes, almost entirely superseded the others, and became
the ordinary legislature of the later Republic. Now the
decline of the Republic was exactly the period during which
the Qu&aelig;stiones Perpetu&aelig; were established, so that the statutes
creating them were all passed by a legislative assembly which
itself could not, at its ordinary sittings, punish a criminal
with death. It followed that the Permanent Judicial Commissions,
holding a delegated authority, were circumscribed
in their attributes and capacities by the limits of the powers
residing with the body which deputed them. They could do
nothing which the Assembly of the Tribes could not have
done; and, as the Assembly could not sentence to death,
the Qu&aelig;stiones were equally incompetent to award capital
punishment. The anomaly thus resulting was not viewed in
ancient times with anything like the favour which it has
attracted among the moderns, and indeed, while it is questionable
whether the Roman character was at all the better for
it, it is certain that the Roman Constitution was a great deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the worse. Like every other institution which has accompanied
the human race down the current of its history, the
punishment of death is a necessity of society in certain stages
of the civilising process. There is a time when the attempt
to dispense with it baulks both of the two great instincts
which lie at the root of all penal law. Without it, the community
neither feels that it is sufficiently revenged on the
criminal, nor thinks that the example of his punishment is
adequate to deter others from imitating him. The incompetence
of the Roman Tribunals to pass sentence of death
led distinctly and directly to those frightful Revolutionary
intervals, known as the Proscriptions, during which all law
was formally suspended simply because party violence could
find no other avenue to the vengeance for which it was thirsting.
No cause contributed so powerfully to the decay of
political capacity in the Roman people as this periodical
abeyance of the laws; and, when it had once been resorted
to, we need not hesitate to assert that the ruin of Roman
liberty became merely a question of time. If the practice of
the Tribunals had afforded an adequate vent for popular
passion, the forms of judicial procedure would no doubt have
been as flagrantly perverted as with us in the reigns of the
later Stuarts, but national character would not have suffered
as deeply as it did, nor would the stability of Roman institutions
have been as seriously enfeebled.</p>

<p>I will mention two more singularities of the Roman Criminal
System which were produced by the same theory of judicial
authority. They are, the extreme multiplicity of the Roman
criminal tribunals, and the capricious and anomalous classification
of crimes which characterised Roman penal jurisprudence
throughout its entire history. Every <i>Qu&aelig;stio</i>, it
has been said, whether Perpetual or otherwise, had its origin
in a distinct statute. From the law which created it, it
derived its authority; it rigorously observed the limits which
its charter prescribed to it, and touched no form of criminality
which that charter did not expressly define. As then
the statutes which constituted the various Qu&aelig;stiones were
all called forth by particular emergencies, each of them being
in fact passed to punish a class of acts which the circumstances
of the time rendered particularly odious or particularly
dangerous, these enactments made not the slightest reference
to each other, and were connected by no common principle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Twenty or thirty different criminal laws were in existence
together, with exactly the same number of Qu&aelig;stiones to
administer them; nor was any attempt made during the
Republic to fuse these distinct judicial bodies into one, or
to give symmetry to the provisions of the statutes which
appointed them and defined their duties. The state of the
Roman criminal jurisdiction at this period, exhibited some resemblances
to the administration of civil remedies in England
at the time when the English Courts of Common Law had not
as yet introduced those fictitious averments into their writs
which enabled them to trespass on each other's peculiar
province. Like the Qu&aelig;stiones, the Courts of Queen's Bench,
Common Pleas, and Exchequer were all theoretical emanations
from a higher authority, and each entertained a special
class of cases supposed to be committed to it by the fountain
of its jurisdiction; but then the Roman Qu&aelig;stiones were
many more than three in number, and it was infinitely less
easy to discriminate the acts which fell under the cognisance
of each Qu&aelig;stio, than to distinguish between the provinces of
the three Courts in Westminster Hall. The difficulty of drawing
exact lines between the spheres of the different Qu&aelig;stiones
made the multiplicity of Roman tribunals something
more than a mere inconvenience; for we read with astonishment
that when it was not immediately clear under what
general description a man's alleged offences ranged themselves,
he might be indicted at once or successively before
several different Commissions, on the chance of some one of
them declaring itself competent to convict him; and, although
conviction by one Qu&aelig;stio ousted the jurisdiction of the rest,
acquittal by one of them could not be pleaded to an accusation
before another. This was directly contrary to the rule
of the Roman civil law; and we may be sure that a people so
sensitive as the Romans to anomalies (or, as their significant
phrase was, to <i>inelegancies</i>) in jurisprudence, would not long
have tolerated it, had not the melancholy history of the
Qu&aelig;stiones caused them to be regarded much more as temporary
weapons in the hands of factions than as permanent
institutions for the correction of crime. The Emperors soon
abolished this multiplicity and conflict of jurisdiction; but
it is remarkable that they did not remove another singularity
of the criminal law which stands in close connection with the
number of the Courts. The classifications of crimes which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
contained even in the Corpus Juris of Justinian are remarkably
capricious. Each Qu&aelig;stio had, in fact, confined itself to
the crimes committed to its cognisance by its charter. These
crimes, however, were only classed together in the original
statute because they happened to call simultaneously for
castigation at the moment of passing it. They had not therefore
anything necessarily in common; but the fact of their
constituting the particular subject-matter of trials before a
particular Qu&aelig;stio impressed itself naturally on the public
attention, and so inveterate did the association become between
the offences mentioned in the same statute that, even
when formal attempts were made by Sylla and by the Emperor
Augustus to consolidate the Roman criminal law, the legislator
preserved the old grouping. The Statutes of Sylla and
Augustus were the foundation of the penal jurisprudence of
the Empire, and nothing can be more extraordinary than
some of the classifications which they bequeathed to it. I
need only give a single example in the fact that <i>perjury</i> was
always classed with <i>cutting and wounding</i> and with <i>poisoning</i>,
no doubt because a law of Sylla, the Lex Cornelia de
Sicariis et Veneficis, had given jurisdiction over all these three
forms of crime to the same Permanent Commission. It seems
too that this capricious grouping of crimes affected the
vernacular speech of the Romans. People naturally fell into
the habit of designating all the offences enumerated in one
law by the first name on the list, which doubtless gave its
style to the Law Court deputed to try them all. All the
offences tried by the Qu&aelig;stio De Adulteriis would thus be
called Adultery.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on the history and characteristics of the
Roman Qu&aelig;stiones because the formation of a criminal jurisprudence
is nowhere else so instructively exemplified. The
last Qu&aelig;stiones were added by the Emperor Augustus, and
from that time the Romans may be said to have had a tolerably
complete criminal law. Concurrently with its growth,
the analogous process had gone on, which I have called the
conversion of Wrongs into Crimes, for, though the Roman
legislature did not extinguish the civil remedy for the more
heinous offences, it offered the sufferer a redress which he was
sure to prefer. Still, even after Augustus had completed his
legislation, several offences continued to be regarded as
Wrongs, which modern societies look upon exclusively as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Crimes; nor did they become criminally punishable till some
late but uncertain date, at which the law began to take notice
of a new description of offences called in the Digest <i>crimina
extraordinaria</i>. These were doubtless a class of acts which the
theory of Roman jurisprudence treated merely as wrongs;
but the growing sense of the majesty of society revolted from
their entailing nothing worse on their perpetrator than the
payment of money damages, and accordingly the injured
person seems to have been permitted, if he pleased, to pursue
them as crimes <i>extra ordinem</i>, that is by a mode of redress
departing in some respect or other from the ordinary procedure.
From the period at which these <i>crimina extraordinaria</i>
were first recognised, the list of crimes in the Roman State
must have been as long as in any community of the modern
world.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe with any minuteness the mode
of administering criminal justice under the Roman Empire,
but it is to be noted that both its theory and practice have
had powerful effect on modern society. The Emperors did
not immediately abolish the Qu&aelig;stiones, and at first they
committed an extensive criminal jurisdiction to the Senate,
in which, however servile it might show itself in fact, the
Emperor was no more nominally than a Senator like the rest.
But some sort of collateral criminal jurisdiction had been
claimed by the Prince from the first; and this, as recollections
of the free commonwealth decayed, tended steadily to gain
at the expense of the old tribunals. Gradually the punishment
of crimes was transferred to magistrates directly
nominated by the Emperor and the privileges of the Senate
passed to the Imperial Privy Council, which also became a
Court of ultimate criminal appeal. Under these influences the
doctrine, familiar to the moderns, insensibly shaped itself
that the Sovereign is the fountain of all Justice and the depositary
of all Grace. It was not so much the fruit of increasing
adulation and servility as of the centralisation of the
Empire which had by this time perfected itself. The theory
of criminal justice had, in fact, worked round almost to the
point from which it started. It had begun in the belief that it
was the business of the collective community to avenge its
own wrongs by its own hand; and it ended in the doctrine
that the chastisement of crimes belonged in an especial
manner to the Sovereign as representative and mandatary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
his people. The new view differed from the old one chiefly
in the air of awfulness and majesty which the guardianship of
justice appeared to throw around the person of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>This later Roman view of the Sovereign's relation to
justice certainly assisted in saving modern societies from the
necessity of travelling through the series of changes which I
have illustrated by the history of the Qu&aelig;stiones. In the
primitive law of almost all the races which have peopled
Western Europe there are vestiges of the archaic notion that
the punishment of crimes belongs to the general assembly
of freemen; and there are some States&mdash;Scotland is said to
be one of them&mdash;in which the parentage of the existing
judicature can be traced up to a Committee of the legislative
body. But the development of the criminal law was universally
hastened by two causes, the memory of the Roman
Empire and the influence of the Church. On the one hand
traditions of the majesty of the C&aelig;sars, perpetuated by the
temporary ascendency of the House of Charlemagne, were
surrounding Sovereigns with a prestige which a mere barbarous
chieftain could never otherwise have acquired and
were communicating to the pettiest feudal potentate the
character of guardian of society and representative of the
State. On the other hand, the Church, in its anxiety to put
a curb on sanguinary ferocity, sought about for authority to
punish the graver misdeeds, and found it in those passages of
Scripture which speak with approval of the powers of punishment
committed to the civil magistrate. The New Testament
was appealed to as proving that secular rulers exist for the
terror of evildoers; the Old Testament, as laying down that
"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be
shed." There can be no doubt, I imagine, that modern ideas
on the subject of crime are based upon two assumptions contended
for by the Church in the Dark Ages&mdash;first, that each
feudal ruler, in his degree, might be assimilated to the Roman
Magistrates spoken of by Saint Paul; and next, that the
offences which he was to chastise were those selected for
prohibition in the Mosaic Commandments, or rather such of
them as the Church did not reserve to her own cognisance.
Heresy (supposed to be included in the First and Second
Commandments), Adultery, and Perjury were ecclesiastical
offences, and the Church only admitted the co-operation of
the secular arm for the purpose of inflicting severer punishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
in cases of extraordinary aggravation. At the same
time, she taught that murder and robbery with their various
modifications were under the jurisdiction of civil rulers, not
as an accident of their position but by the express ordinance
of God.</p>

<p>There is a passage in the writings of King Alfred (Kemble,
ii. 209) which brings out into remarkable clearness the struggle
of the various ideas that prevailed in his day as to the origin
of criminal jurisdiction. It will be seen that Alfred attributes
it partly to the authority of the Church and partly to that
of the Witan, while he expressly claims for treason against
the lord the same immunity from ordinary rules which the
Roman Law of Majestas had assigned to treason against the
C&aelig;sar. "After this it happened," he writes, "that many
nations received the faith of Christ, and there were many
synods assembled throughout the earth, and among the English
race also after they had received the faith of Christ, both of
holy bishops and of their exalted Witan. They then ordained
that, out of that mercy which Christ had taught, secular lords,
with their leave, might without sin take for every misdeed
the <i>bot</i> in money which they ordained; except in cases of
treason against a lord, to which they dared not assign any
mercy because Almighty God adjudged none to them that
despised Him, nor did Christ adjudge any to them which sold
Him to death; and He commanded that a lord should be
loved like Himself."</p>
